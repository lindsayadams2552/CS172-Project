Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge makes such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses think those problems are gone.\n\nJD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance\u2019s benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.\n\nPalantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don\u2019t like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it\u2019s secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.\n\nEdit: gift article very nicely given by u/ Advanced_Level\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.h6d7.ZwcbvFMgtpjZ&smid=url-share\n\nPalantir which is led by real life German nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70\u2019s where Peter Thiel\u2019s father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.\n\nAnyone that\u2019s says Peter Thiel doesn\u2019t control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7\n\nTimothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2024/07/22/jd-vance-owes-almost-everything-to-peter-thiel-a-pro-billionaire-and-new-right-ideologue/\n\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html", "And to feed into its own AI system  (that unronically hates Musk)", "Also treason and colluding with enemies foreign and domestic", "Eliminating the entities that can prevent corruption is another.", "And destroying key safety nets.", "This article is the problem.

The heritability of IQ increases with the child's age and reaches a plateau at 14\u201316[9] years old, continuing at that level well into adulthood. However, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease are known to have lifelong deleterious effects.[10][11] Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5[1] to a high of 0.8 (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated).[12] Eric Turkheimer and colleagues (2003) found that for children of low socioeconomic status heritability of IQ falls almost to zero.[13] These results have been challenged by other researchers. IQ heritability increases during early childhood, but it is unclear whether it stabilizes thereafter.[14] A 1996 statement by the American Psychological Association gave about 0.45 for children and about .75 during and after adolescence.[15] A 2004 meta-analysis of reports in Current Directions in Psychological Science gave an overall estimate of around 0.85 for 18-year-olds and older.[16] The general figure for heritability of IQ is about 0.5 across multiple studies in varying populations.[17]\u201d", "In that same Wikipedia article they talk about how it\u2019s highly flawed, also success and intelligence are not the same.

This is apparently because g is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings.[64]\nIn elementary school, the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50\u2013.60, .40\u2013.50, and .30\u2013.40, respectively. The g loadings of IQ scores are high, but it is possible that some of the validity of IQ in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by IQ independent of g. According to research by Robert L. Thorndike, 80 to 90 percent of the predictable variance in scholastic performance is due to g, with the rest attributed to non-g factors measured by IQ and other tests.[71]\u201d", "\u201cCritics have contended that an emphasis on g is misplaced and entails a devaluation of other important abilities.

Now America has a president that has no interest in win-win relationships. Trump's philosophy is a zero sum game where there must be winners and losers.\n\nThe best summation of Trump's style I've seen comes from negotiation lawyer and teacher David Honig:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don\u2019t know, I\u2019m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations.\n\nOkay, here goes.\n\nTrump, as most of us know, is the credited author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you\u2019ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you\u2019ve followed Trump lately, you\u2019ll know, even if you didn\u2019t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call \u201cdistributive bargaining.\u201d\n\nDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you\u2019re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump\u2019s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for the construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.\n\nThe other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don\u2019t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.\n\nThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can\u2019t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren\u2019t binary. China\u2019s choices aren\u2019t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don\u2019t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.\n\nOne of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you\u2019re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don\u2019t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won\u2019t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you\u2019re going to have to find another cabinet maker.\n\nSo when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.\n\nTrump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.\n\nTrump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that\u2019s just not how politics works, not over the long run.\n\nFor people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here\u2019s another huge problem for us.\n\nTrump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.\n\nFrom a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn\u2019t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He\u2019s bringing a quarter that he insists on flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Gr\u00fcnfeld.\u201d\n\n\u2014 David Honig\n\n[Source](https://www.cmpartners.com/negotiation/the-importance-of-value-creation/)", "Well at least Trump said on Sunday that he doesn't think a military invasion will be necessary to make Canada the 51st state.

Glenn Youngkin\u2019s call for the party\u2019s lieutenant-governor nominee to step aside \u2014 after the hopeful was accused of posting gay porn on Tumblr.\n\nYoungkin asked embattled candidate John Reid, a radio host in the Richmond area, to withdraw as the nominee upon learning of the images of naked men posted on an account using Reid\u2019s Instagram handle last month.\n\nReid has denied the account is his and refused to step aside \u2014 leaving party faithful scrambling to unify about six months out from the state\u2019s bellwether 2025 off-year election.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my account,\u201d Reid insisted after the scandal was unearthed by the Richmonder. \u201cAnyone on the Internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nAllies of Reid have accused Youngkin and his allies of targeting the candidate because of his sexuality. Reid is Virginia\u2019s first openly gay statewide nominee.\n\nBut Youngkin has deemed the gay-porn scandal a \u201cdistraction\u201d that will likely hurt the party if allowed to continue.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why I called John last Friday morning was because these kinds of situations, where there is just a historical recognition that social media and explicit, explicit social media content like this is a distraction,\u201d Youngkin told reporters last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a distraction for campaigns, and it\u2019s a distraction from people paying attention to the most important issues, and here we are today talking about fentanyl and saving lives, and the distraction is present,\u201d he said. \u201cHe and I had a very serious personal conversation.\u201d\n\nSeveral key Republicans in the state quickly hit back at the governor for being so quick to turn on Reid.\n\nIf this is how the Governor\u2019s political operation wants to close out his term in Richmond \u2014 by tossing a grenade into the statewide Republican ticket \u2014 it\u2019s truly a shame,\u201d Arlington GOP Chair Matthew Hurt said in an email blast. \n\nVirginia gubernatorial wannabe and current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, refrained from calling on Reid to step aside.\n\n\u201cJohn Reid is the Republican nominee for Lt. Governor. It is his race and his decision alone to move forward,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe all have our own race to run.\u201d\n\nEarle-Sears is locked in a very tough gubernatorial race against former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Dems\u2019 pick in the state race. Youngkin cannot run for re-election this time around, as Virginia governors can\u2019t serve two consecutive terms.\n\nAfter days of controversy, Youngkin began striking a more conciliatory tone toward Reid and stressed that it would ultimately be the nominee\u2019s decision about whether to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get on with winning. This is John Reid\u2019s decision. He is the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor,\u201d Youngkin told reporters late last week. \u201cHe has clearly made up his mind that he\u2019s going to stay in.\n\n\u201cI think the debate can stop there, \u2019cause that\u2019s the answer. I have said that I will support the nominees and their ticket.\u201d\n\nMatt Moran, who has been a longtime top staffer for Youngkin and helmed the Spirit of Virginia PAC, denied accusations that he had been conspiring to pressure Reid out of the race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known John Reid for years and consider him a friend,\u201d Moran said on X last week.\n\n\u201cOver the last nine days, I was actively supporting and assisting John as the Lt. Governor nominee of the Republican Party. Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded.\u201d\n\nYoungkin, who previously served as co-CEO of financial powerhouse The Carlyle Group, won the governor\u2019s office in an upset 2021 election. He is the first Republican governor to win the top Virginia office since 2009.\n\nThat breakthrough has sparked presidential buzz for Youngkin and led to speculation that he could be a contender in the 2028 elections.\n\nMeanwhile, he is hoping to preserve GOP gains in the state, which has generally hewed blue in the past two decades.\n\nBut Republicans are facing significant headwinds in Virginia heading into the off-year election. The state, alongside New Jersey, is generally seen as a barometer of the national mood that could foreshadow what will happen in the 2026 midterms.\n\nNestled next to Washington, DC, Virginia has been disproportionately battered by job cuts the Trump administration has made through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nVirginia is home to about 145,000 federal workers, at least a fifth of whom reside just across the Potomac River from DC. To counter this, Youngkin has launched a website, virginiahasjobs.com, as well as a resource package for those unemployed thanks to the cuts.\n\nThe GOP is fearing that voter backlash against the Trump administration could be a boon for Virginia Democrats come November.", "The fact that Republicans get all huffy over gay porn but are chill with our constitution being gutted by their own party is very telling lol\u00a0", "The only fair thing here is for the GOP to post a link to this Tumblr account.

The explicit images The Richmonder viewed were reposts and did not show Reid himself. The Tumblr page appeared to have been taken down shortly after The Richmonder published this story.

A second high-end residential tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Two cryptocurrency ventures based in the United States. A new golf course and villa complex in Qatar. And a new private club in Washington. In many cases these new deals promoted over the last week will personally benefit not only Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but also President Trump himself.\n\n\u201cChallenge everything,\u201d said the brochure for the new $1 billion, 80-story Trump International Hotel and Tower planned for Dubai, where units went on sale for the first time at prices reaching $20 million apiece, after a giant party held in Dubai this past week to honor Eric Trump and the new project. \u201cStop at nothing.\u201d\n\nThe marathon of deal making has been so rapid that many elements have drawn limited public attention in the United States, despite most of it being out in the open. That is in part because the sons appeared before mostly fawning crowds but also because President Trump, his appointees and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk were making headlines with their own steady stream of norm-breaking controversies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University historian who has written books on Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford, addressing the financial conflicts of interest that have emerged in Mr. Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nBoth Trump sons are involved in a wide range of family business ventures. Eric Trump, the president\u2019s middle son, runs the Trump Organization, the main family business, which specializes in real estate. He also serves on the board of a holding company that oversees World Liberty Financial, the family\u2019s crypto firm, and recently joined forces with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., to start a Bitcoin mining operation, American Bitcoin.\n\nThe White House has said there are no ethics issues because Mr. Trump\u2019s sons run the businesses. \u201cThe president\u2019s assets are in a trust managed by his children,\u201d Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said. \u201cThere are no conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure report, which he is legally required to file, shows that he still personally benefits financially from most of these ventures.\n\n\u2026\u2026\n\n\nEven as these real-life ventures were playing out, another push for profit was underway in the virtual world. Investors in the $Trump memecoin are bidding to become the top 220 owners of the collectible coin and win a dinner with the president later this month. A memecoin is a type of cryptocurrency based on an online joke or celebrity mascot that has no practical function other than speculation.\n\nThe $Trump memecoin is controlled by a company run by the Trump sons and their business partners, but President Trump has actively encouraged his supporters to buy it.\n\nJavier Selgas, chief executive at Fr8Tech, a shipping company, announced this past week \u2014 while Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were abroad \u2014 that his Monterrey, Mexico-based company would spend $20 million to buy $Trump memecoin tokens.\u201d", "Family of crooks.", "Treason from within", "They've been much more quiet this time around so you know they're busy behind the scenes violating the emolument's clause as extensively as possible.", "They went after Hunter with fervor.

This was plain corruption and there's no excuse for it, and despite Trump's efforts to play coy in front of reporters.\n\nmoving on:\n\nTrump has spent his entire life and career taking advantage of his power and privilege to enrich himself at the expense of others.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump committed to improving Chinese IP protections and opening up its financial sector to US businesses, which conflicted with his personal real estate ambitions in China, including dozens of properties and hotels.\n\nIn 2020, it was revealed that Trump also had previously undisclosed bank accounts in China and during his first term, his family benefitted financially from trademarks from the Chinese government.\n\n**Trump the \"business man\":**\n\nTrump is a notorious financial fraud who has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.\n\nHere's a long list of Trump's business failures:\n\n- Trump Casinos and Hotels \n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\n- Trump Magazine\n- Trump Airlines\n- Trump Beverages\n- Trump \"The Game\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\n- Trump Mortgages\n- Trump Steaks\n- Trump Travel Site\n- Trumpnet\n- Trump Tower Tampa\n- Trump Vodka\n- Trump Fragrances\n- Trump Mattress\n- Trump Network\n- Tour de Trump\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\n- Truth Social (due to its wild overvaluation and massive losses.)\n\nHe has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.\n\nTrump has profited off of screwing over small businesses and financial associates who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. \n\nHe has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties, he even lied to get on the Forbes list, and he often threatens to sue anyone who publicly speculates about his real net worth.\n\nOver a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. But he continued borrowing money, particularly from his father and from banks, which allowed him to avoid paying income tax for many years, all while he amassed unsustainable debts, only to dump them onto others later.\n\nThen his lucky break, The Apprentice. The show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.\n\nThis isn't even the half of it, but it's clear so far that Donald Trump is not the economic genius he's touted as by both him and his supporters. He's simply spent his entire life cashing in on his circumstances at the expense of others.\n\nLet's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes\n\nAdditionally, as part of the settlement, Trump was required to acknowledge his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation. The settlement also included mandatory training requirements for Don  Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump. Finally, the settlement required the Trump Foundation to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision.\n\nThen there's Trump University...\n\nIn 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University. New York regulators forced Trump to stop using the term \"university\" to describe his scheme, calling Trump's use of the word, \"misleading and even illegal.\"\n\nFormer students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.\n\nThere was also a separate class action lawsuit against Trump University, Trump's counterclaims were dismissed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against one of the students who made her experiences at the \"university\" public. Trump University was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and extra costs. Trump was eventually found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.\n\nTrump is also known infamously for not paying what he owes. This includes hundreds of millions in loan forgiveness and legal penalties, and unpaid bills for rally costs at cities around the country.\n\nAs president, Donald Trump directed taxpayer money towards his businesses. The secret service and other government parties were forced to overspend at Trump properties and on accommodations.\n\nTrump often made foreign and domestic business deals while president. Booking events for foreign governments at Trump owned locations in order to curry favor with his admin.\n\nTrump promoted his properties while President, and hosted taxpayer funded events.\n\nPrior to his inauguration, Trump met in private with several billionaires. These billionaires pledged millions of dollars towards his presidency and were invited to sit in the VIP section at his inauguration while his supporters stood out in the cold. How symbolic.\n\nThese plutocrats, oligarchs and special interests assured Trump that they will be in lockstep with his administration, and an administration that is the richest in US history. Populism my ass...\n\nTrump is a notorious grifter. Selling everything from hats, T-shirts, clothing and accessories, to watches and jewelry, NFTs and digital collectibles, commemorative medallions and coins, Trump currency and trading cards, tacky sneakers, overpriced Bibles, cologne and perfume, among Trump branded merchandise that he continuously suckers his followers into buying. Easy money that typically gets reserved for his legal fees. \n\nMake no mistake here, Donald Trump is not \"America first,\" he is Trump first, *always.* He is always thinking of ways to exploit his power and privilege to enrich himself.

Has.", "The immediate costs of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war are fairly clear. Prices for imported goods are rising while economic growth is slowing.   \n  \nManufacturers are slashing orders, small businesses with Chinese suppliers are on the brink of insolvency, interest rates are rising, Americans\u2019 retirement savings are bleeding value, and consumers are losing confidence.   \n  \nThe severity of these consequences remain to be seen. But even the administration\u2019s defenders concede that Trump\u2019s tariffs will entail some economic pain in the near-term.\n\nThe real question concerns the long-term impacts of Trump\u2019s misgovernance. The US economy has rebounded from severe shocks twice this century.   \n  \nIf neither the 2008 financial crisis nor the Covid pandemic durably reduced America\u2019s living standards, it\u2019s reasonable to suppose that our nation will shake off the effects of Trump\u2019s misrule in due time.\n\nYet there are reasons to fear that his policies will render Americans permanently poorer \u2014 at least, relative to the level of prosperity they might have otherwise attained. Trump\u2019s defunding of scientific research threatens to lastingly hinder US innovation, while his discouragement of immigration could constrain long-term economic growth.\n\nTo many financial analysts, however, the biggest risk is that Trump could permanently reduce the value of the dollar.\n\nCurrently, the US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency \u2014 the one used in a majority of the world\u2019s international transactions. To see how this works, consider what happens when a Mexican farmer wants to sell pig meat to a South Korean restaurant chain.   \n  \nThe South Korean company probably doesn\u2019t have a ton of pesos in the bank, and the Mexican farmer doesn\u2019t have much use for the South Korean won. The two parties need some medium exchange that is widely accessible, universally trusted, and easily convertible into their local currencies.   \n  \nThe dollar is that medium: The South Korean company exchanges won for dollars, buys the pork with those dollars, and then the Mexican farmer exchanges his hard-won greenbacks for pesos.\n\nThe dollar\u2019s reserve status keeps demand for America\u2019s currency and debt artificially high, and thus, our nation\u2019s borrowing and consumer costs unusually low.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s erratic and belligerent trade agenda has shaken global investors\u2019 confidence in both America\u2019s economic and political stability. Among bankers and foreign governments, talk of \u201cde-dollarization\u201d has spiked.\n\n\u23ec Bluesky 'bite-sized' article thread (15 min) with extra links \ud83d\udcd6\ud83c\udf7f\ud83d\udd0a\n\n[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3loh3f4l35s2o](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3loh3f4l35s2o)  \n  \n[archive.is/JQLvk](https://archive.is/JQLvk)", "Honestly, my wallet\u2019s been in survival mode since 2016.", "He is telling his cult now how he has done a beautifully wonderful job and everything good is because of him EXCEPT the bad, the bad is Biden's fault.

They just needed to say \u201cmaybe later\u201d to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers.\n> \n> The U.S.? Let\u2019s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What\u2019s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, \u201cHey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.\u201d\n> \n> Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up.

Why Rubio would trade a relatively secure senate job for Secretary of State to a moron who likes to play the you are fired game is one of the bigger head scratchers I've ever seen. I can't tell if Rubio genuinely saw this as some duty to check Trump's worst impulses or if he was dumb and saw this as an opportunity for the spotlight. Regardless it made no sense.

You don\u2019t become, let alone stay, a billionaire without having a deeply unhealthy relationship to wealth\u2014there\u2019s a reason why billionaires are driving climate change so heavily.

Now, well, here we are. I gave it to you straight last year, and I\u2019m going to give it to you straight again tonight. In this fragile moment, the direction of this nation will turn on who we choose to listen to, whose stories we decide to tell about what is happening, who we elevate and who we ignore, who we find noteworthy and who we label as just noise. Who we listen to will shape the way we react to events as they unfold.", "Um, no one is ever going to \"bring back jobs to America\".  Trump and his tariffs aren't going to do it.  Good paying jobs with  benefits don't have to be done in factories.  Unions can have a role in elevating the standard of living in human centric positions, particularly services where they have already had an impact.\n\nAmerican workers are too expensive to produce products at a competitive price for the markets businesses want to sell to.  Since the 70s and 80s, workers have been replaced with automation where possible, shrinking the number of factory jobs that need humans to work.  If a job can be done by someone without an education, it's done more cheaply abroad, wherever that may be.  An awful lot of money is being spent to create human-equivalent robots that work 24 hours a day at a price much cheaper than an American worker.", "Definitely feels like Pritzker is being pushed lately as who we should get behind for the nod.

Listen to his speech last week; it is just words but it shows more direction and resolve than most dems have shown since November- hell, even earlier than that.", "I know some hardcore radical lefties in Chicago and they all live Pritzker. He's the real deal. Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, and JFK were all old money progressives, so it's hardly unheard of.", "Well done. Keep opposing our allies. It\u2019s working!

He overcame the Clinton establishment in the 2008 primaries, then the crash happened, and he had to save the country. He then had to choose either to focus on healthcare, or financial reform with his limited political capital. He chose healthcare and we almost got a public option, if not for Joe Lieberman in New York screwing us.

We used to have subsidies for arts, many other countries still do. CDProjekt, a Polish videogame studio, got 7 million USD from the government of Poland in 2016.
