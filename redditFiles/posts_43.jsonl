Dude had 14 top 10 singles and freaking 7 number 1 singles. Condo Lauper had 8 and 2. And Cyndi Lauper wasn\u2019t the cultural force that Phil Collins was.

That all grew organically. Sure there\u2019s a similar scene, but that has more to do with human nature in response to improvisational music. Correlation is not causation.

You\u2019re right about the White Album, but Sgt Peppers was kinda where it all started to crumble. At that time, Paul was probably the biggest culprit - he became very particular about certain sounds and playing/recording live was just not gonna achieve the vision.\n\nAs for them growing apart - it got to a point where they saw each other less and less while their fame and egos continued to grow, which naturally led to distance between each other while outside influences targeted those young egos, wedged in, and pulled the band members apart even further. \n\nAll of this is to say that you\u2019re right that they couldn\u2019t stand each other at the time of the White Album and didn\u2019t record many of the songs together. *And also* their music styles and notoriety changed to such a degree that it was no longer feasible to record and tour together, which led to the distance between them.", ">*The White Album* was recorded without all four of them being in the same place at the same time.
