Mother Storm (aka God Tempest) was an enormous cosmic storm that destroyed everything in its path. It came for Asgard, so Odin fought her for forever until he was finally able to wrestle the storm down. He struck the storm with a chunk of Uru that the dwarves had gifted to him. The storm was then contained in the Uru and Odin had the Dwarves form the chunk of Uru into a hammer. The storm raging in the hammer gave it such power that Odin saw the need to enchant the hammer so that only the worthy could wield it. When Jane Foster wields it, she can control its movements in mid air, whereas Thor Odinson can merely throw it and have it come back to him. \n\n\nSo if they use any of this (I doubt it) perhaps Jane will  be able to form a strong bond with the Mother Storm and her bond will enable her to manipulate the power of the Mother Storm so that the pieces come together and form the hammer again.", "Watching the trailer I\u2019m pretty sure I saw Zeus (there was a man who caught a lightning rod and was wearing a gold and white outfit which reminded me of Zeus and his rod and the Greek deity attire) and I think that either the actual Greek god or another living eternal (cuz the eternals are where the Greek myths came from) helped fix it", "Well people are saying shes worthy so it came back together but that should\u2019ve worked with thor", "I\u2019m guessing air plane glue \n\nPortman was quoted saying a while ago: \n\n>Don't test when I'm crazy on that airplane glue\nPut my foot down your throat\n'Til you shit in my shoe", "The ether + the multiple snap energy around the world + cancer somehow will equal magical powers", "In the comics, the hammer is sentient, if I remember correctly.

Besides, Thor never really needed the hammer; Odin said as much.", "Eitri could maybe put it back together or they could have some other explanation but imo the simplest and most likely way is that Jane becomes worthy at some point and the hammer reconstructs itself as she holds out her hand and transforms into Thor for the first time", "But also ragnarok stated that Thor's power isn't in his hammer but inside of him..", "Flextape, it even works underwater", "\u201cMark me as scared and horny\u201d  \n\nseriously she looks so buff.

In the comics, Tony actually dies at one point, but he had so much weird tech in his body to better pilot the suits, it ended up \"rebooting\" his system (it was kind of dumb).

Tony seems to prefer less firepower but more speed.", "It could just as easily be the other way around. The US military no longer wants to depend solely on Stark tech. They want a suit that they can re-arm in the field, replace weapon systems with existing systems, etc.", "Well, there's also the fact that, as we saw in *Iron Man 3*, Tony's suits are a bit of a \"test bed\" for the most advanced technology that *Tony* can think of - if something goes wrong (in a fundamental-design-sense) with Tony's suit, Tony can fix it on-the-fly, which is something that Rhodey cannot do but Tony most certainly can (and DOES!). The fact that Tony's suits are often a technical generation ahead of the War Machine armor is not about trust so much as the fact that Tony is inventing the technology of that \"next generation\" *as he goes*. And it's *not* a bad thing that the War Machine armor is a generation behind the Iron Man armor either; a robust technology is a more dependable technology in combat situations. Just sayin'. \n\nAlso, Rhodey, for all his gifts as a warrior, is just that: a warrior. Give him a hammer, he will know all the best uses that hammer can be put to; give Tony Stark a hammer, on the other hand, and he will know all the best things that hammer can be made *into*, for Tony Stark's gift is not that of a warrior, but that of a creative, an inventor.\n\nSo, I disagree - I think there are entirely valid reasons for the War Machine armor to be a generation behind the mainline Iron Man armor that have nothing to do with whether or not Tony \"trusts\" Rhodey or not, the same as with Pepper and the RESCUE suit (a personal favorite, BTW) both of which have specific roles and are therefore VERY specialized equipment.", "Which is weird considering the very first time Tony gets flying around in the suit he literally encounters a scenario where a parachute would be pretty useful.", "Everybody says that but it could also be because...parachutes are a good idea?

His God of Thunder upgrade wasn\u2019t enough to save Heimdall, Loki, and half of the remaining Asgardians. **And this is peak Thor, as he has been constantly battling and in fighting form for 1,500 years, with even some \u201ctraining\u201d against Hulk**. \n\nAdd to that alll of that loss \u2014 Frigga, Odin, Heimdall, Sif + Warriors 3, 1/2 of Asgard \u2014 and it fuels a properly vengeful and formidable God of Thunder already by the beginning of Act III of IW, as he\u2019s able to withstand a freaking star\u2019s concentrated beam. \n\nHe gets literally the most powerful weapons upgrade that any Asgardian (and arguably any entity) can get in Stormbreaker. \n\nSo, by the time Thor launches Stormbreaker at Thanos, he has earned that power to be able to cut through the Infinity Guantlet\u2019s powers and have Thanos nearly dead to rights (but as we all know, that same thirst for vengeance is exactly what allowed The Snap to happen). \n\n**Basically, at least IW Thor earned his literal god-Tier powers through plot, rather than the plot accommodating him with an arbitrary power level without effort or sacrifice.**\n\nAs for Carol, I know Carol hasn\u2019t had much screen time, but she is kind of in between \u201cshe is as powerful as the plot needs her to be\u201d and having legitimately earned her powers. \n\nIn 1995, she finally gets full access to her Space Stone + Power Core capable of Limitless/FTL energy. But clearly, she\u2019s holding back when she finally gets those powers, or she just hasn\u2019t tested her full potential \u2014 which is kind of like Wanda, also created by an Infinity Stone, goes from moving toy blocks to being able to fight off a near fully-powered Thanos while destroying the Mind Stone (of course, this sort of raises the question of how Captain Marvel can withstand a Power Stone blast and Wanda can dual wield her powers to that degree while Quicksilver\u2019s weakness is...bullets). \n\nBack to Carol \u2014 my head canon is that by the time she unlocked her powers in 1995 she was able to withstand a Power Stone blast, but hadn\u2019t had the 25 years of experience with her powers to be able to do what she did in Endgame. \n\n**TLDR \u2014 usually I\u2019d agree with the \u201cplot accommodating the heroes\u201d reason, but here IMO the powers derive from proper plotting. In IW, Thor\u2019s powers and weaponry had gone through a multi-film arc of being built-up to 100%, and Endgame Carol\u2019s Powers were likely that powerful from the start, and she honed the skills to control and use them during 25 years off-world.**\n\nPS \u2014 Endgame Thor was not arbitrarily weakened.

So what happened to the Hulk we saw in Ragnarok, the guy who was sad that Earth hated and feared him, who felt stupid and clumsy, who was dicking around playing jokes on Thor, who walked around nude with an attitude, and who loved the attention of his fans on Sakar? We didn't see a shred of him in Endgame. Is he dead? Disappeared? Did he just give up and let Banner have the body? All because Thanos threw some hands?\n\nWTF?

Then one day he got utterly bitchslapped, it wasn't a hard fought battle, he got smashed easily. For Hulk the challenge had risen too sharply, too soon and he was terrified, confidence shattered and ego broken, fighting anything just seemed frightening. \n\nTo me that's a pretty cool arc, the genuine worry of will be ever fight again, and if not how vulnerable is Banner!?

I WILL FUCK YOU UP!", "'So you're saying you want another Dark Phoenix movie?' -studio execs", "DC, Sony, and Fox all looked at the MCU with greedy eyes and made the same damned mistakes, albeit with their own individual colorful twists on how to fuck it up. \n\nEveryone saw the shared universe concept take off with mind boggling success with the Avengers, capped off (currently) with Endgame. And everyone thought \u201chey we\u2019ve got licenses to a stable full of similar characters. Let\u2019s trot a few of them out and get our own shared universe going!\u201d  And here\u2019s the thing: it could have worked. It really could have. Despite what the fanboys say, there\u2019s nothing objectively wrong with the DC or Fox source material that makes them unsuitable for a big grand shared universe, something to provide a healthy competition with the MCU. No reason we fans couldn\u2019t have had Pizza AND Burgers to choose from depending on our mood. \n\nBut these other studios got their eyes too set on the prize and didn\u2019t think through what made the MCU successful. They saw the superficial trappings of it and came to the wrong conclusions, it was like the cargo cult of hero movies. They thought if they just put out the trappings of these successful movies they would somehow BE successful movies, without recognizing what else goes into that. They saw gritty realism in place of goofy colorful spandex. They saw movies with big all star casts. They saw dramatic battles with high stakes that aren\u2019t afraid to include the deaths of major characters. They saw humorous quips to lighten the mood occasionally. And all of those things were true!  I don\u2019t mean to say a good shared hero universe shouldn\u2019t have those things, because they really can contribute to the movies. \n\nBut they missed the innards that make those little things worth including. They missed the long game. They missed the part where you should be dropping little plot investments you don\u2019t intend to cash in until years later. Having Loki using multiple infinity stones in 2010 when they wouldn\u2019t be assembled for nearly a decade is a perfect example. These other studios missed that the movies can\u2019t just be a vessel for team ups, you should be able to watch most of them in isolation and have a good viewing experience, with occasional exceptions like a Endgame that are like 5-10% of the movie slate as pure payoff. Everything else should be setup. You could watch Iron Man, or Thor Ragnarok, or Winter Solider with little or no Marvel experience and still come away thinking \u201chey that was a good movie.\u201d  That\u2019s why Man of Steel was a better movie than Batman v Superman: it was comfortable with standing alone as a Superman story. The directors cut of BvS fixed a lot of issues, but even that couldn\u2019t erase the context of the movie: a studio-pushed, accelerated attempt to kickstart the shared universe. It came too soon. We should at least have gotten a Batman, Flash, and maybe Wonder Woman movie before they started throwing them together in major ways. \n\nFox/X-Men made a similar mistake: all the mainline movies were huge team-up movies with world-ending stakes. There were no individual character study movies until the disastrous Wolverine Origins movie and even then he had a huge team of mutants around. The later follow up \u201cThe Wolverine\u201d was a good example of what to do, but it happened after the universe had already been bloated and bogged down. Days of Future Past was saved purely by being one of the best written comic book movies of all time, and I think they should have called it quits right there on a high note. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad that the only way the X-Men material will be successful will be under the MCU umbrella, because I think some healthy competition is good....but if this is what it takes, then OK I guess.

Superman dying in BvS had absolutely zero impact because they rushed to it entirely too quickly and had a complete lack of cohesive story and character development to get to that point. \n\nThe DC universe was haphazardly thrown together in a mad dash to get to the team-up movie, leaving audiences with no time to let the characters grow on them. Sure, these are very established comic book icons, but you have to treat them like the audience is seeing them for the first time since it's about how you're bringing that character to life, not just skipping ahead to where you want to start, hoping the audience came to the show completely vested in what you're selling.\n\nMCU worked because they took their time and built the world intricately and brought audiences along for the ride.

For example Aquaman was decent and it was a pretty lighthearted goofy movie but as a huge Batman fan he needs to be dark and gritty. The MCU is great but we don\u2019t need a carbon copy with different heroes. There are times when I think they should take characters in that direction but I think grit is needed especially for characters like Batman and Superman. The sad thing is some of their flops should have been great movies.

The DCEU wanted it's cake after only eating part of dinner (where as the MCU had an appetizer, two mains with drink pairings, and dessert). Fox was just afraid to lean into the weird shit or the political shit. \n\nSure, X-Men vs Brotherhood of evil is all fine and fantastic, as is X-Men standing up to the government, but that's not where the X-Men become brilliant. God Loves Man Kills, for instance, tears down hate in religion hard, but that's not something that would really fly with the American Right Wing being what it is. The Dark Phoenix saga involves cosmic space beings, aliens, and a bit of weird existentialism. Sure they touched on that in the newest Dark Phoenix movie, but they kept it mundane and grounded.\n\nThe FoX-Men movies were kind of a product of their time and kept their tone throughout all the movies. They were being made when superhero movies were trying to be grounded and kind of ashamed of their source material. Even by the end, they didn't embrace the weirdness and the camp like the MCU does, or Shazam does.\n\nBut that's **my** take as someone who has been reading X-Men since 93. My point of view might come from a different place than yours does. :)", "Stewart has the opposite thing going on. He's just always looked old", "He's fine in the earlier films but it's one of those things where it feels like they didn't know what to do with him in the end, hence the unceremonious exit. I get that they needed to show the danger posed by Jean as well but that whole scene is a mess.\n\nI like First Class and Days of Future Past (for all its faults) but that franchise has got to the same point as the original X-trilogy in that it has outstayed its welcome. I haven't even watched Dark Phoenix. I'm happy with Logan being my last impression of the 2000s X-Men films.", "The comparisons will definitely happen, but good casting makes for good comparisons.

And they could've intro'd smaller characters like Cyborg or Static Shock a little more naturally. It's a great time now because Marvel just climaxed and has to kind of reset. But WB made the mistake of trying to cash in and directly compete with MCU rather than taking the time to plan and see if MCU has staying power.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm suggesting that WB wait a decade on it.

Otherwise, you get X3 Dark Phoenix, who was a character with lowly human motives. All her scenes were either anti-hero style villain team-ups, or petty personal vendettas.\n\nIn the cartoon, Dark Phoenix was just this, *thing*, that would just appear and wreck shit, with the cast shouting at her for answers and getting nothing for a good solid season.\n\nI may also completely be misremembering the cartoon show, its been almost 30 years...", "Exactly this.

So much of what makes an audience like a film ultimately comes down to how you put it, emotional investment. \n\nEven when it's a simple story, if you develop your character right, the audience will love it. John Wick is a prime example of that. Aside from the excellent technical aspects of the film, they spent time giving the audience a way to connect emotionally with John. The story itself was a pretty simplistic revenge story, but they did enough world building around it and the characters within it, that it felt rich and drew the viewer into it. \n\nThat point alone is something DCEU writers should have considered over the complicated jumbled mess they delivered with MoS, BvS and Justice League. If they had been more willing to draw out the stories to make room for their characters to grow, they could have easily gotten 2 movies worth of content out of MoS plotlines, 3 out of BvS and at least 2 more out of JL, not counting all of the independent character movies you mentioned.

They could introduce the Shi'ar in something like Guardians of the Galaxy or Captain Marvel. They could slowly introduce the Hellfire Club in their other Earth-based movies, as well as all the other major players in the story so the actual Phoenix Saga movie(s) wouldn't have to sacrifice a ton of the plot for the sake of exposition.

With that territory, came the unwanted ability of being a bully magnet, and like most shy little weirdos, I couldn't figure out how to be happy. \nThere aren't a lot of outlets for an unhappy kid to latch on to that'll help make them feel better about being different. There was mostly just silence, and telling adults that you were ok, and when the world around you thinks it's purpose is to beat into you that you're wrong for being a shy little weirdo, that silence, is the only thing you have to look forward to.\n\nYou can't tell you're having a life changing experience in the moment, because nothing actually changes that you can immediately recognize. The bullies are still shaking you down, you're still not allowed to have control of the television remote, and you still spend most of your day wishing you could just get back to silence. With age, comes the tragedies, the victories, and general life experience that teach you that your life changed 31 years ago, with a simple spider bite. \n\nStan Lee's legacy can't be summed up by any one thing. He was a writer, that's one. A writer who slowly climbed a pretty short ladder in a very disrespected field. He slogged through writing backup stories, unhappily, until his wife, Joan, convinced him to write just one more story, a story that would be the last in a canceled book. A story that, most likely, wouldn't be read by many. She believed in him, and without realizing, Stan's life would change forever. With \"Amazing Fantasy #15\", he would change American mythology forever.\n\nHe was humble. That's another one. It'd be understandable for a man who contributed so much to pop-culture, to become kind of a jerk. Stan Lee loved his fans. He worked so hard to welcome them into his smile since 1962. He was always ready with a joke and words of encouragement for anyone within earshot. \n\nHe was respectful. Stan's Soapbox was the definitive column for millions of shy little weirdos around the world. He always seemed honored to hear that so many people loved what he lived to do.\n\nHe was a storyteller. \n\nHe was America's Grandpa.\n\nWhen I think of Stan Lee's Legacy, the loudest thought in my head was he believed in us. He knew we were special, no matter how many people told us we never would be. He gave me a hero that looked, sounded, and felt just like me. Like you. Like all of us. By making Peter Parker all of us, he told us that it was ok to be a shy little weirdo that screws up, that falls down. We would be ok, as long as we never gave up. Stan was Peter, just like we were Peter. \n\nCreativity is so, so hard. And thankless, and rarely worth the effort. Creativity is full of second guessing yourself, discouragement, and heartache. It's too easy to always want desperately to quit. Stan Lee's most important legacy, to me, will always be the hope he gave me when he showed me life can change with something as simple as a spider bite. We're going to fall, we're going to cry, and scream, and hurt. But we can't give up.\n\nStan Lee believed in you his entire career.

He's not 'super,' as in he has no powers and practically no help from technology - he's just an incredibly skilled person with an unknown past. But, he's also a father and a husband, which is such a soft and loving side to a dark and stoic character. Also, in some ways, I feel like he's weak; he doesn't have the guarantee of physical or even mental strength that most of the other characters do (aside maybe from Stark or Banner's fragile psyches). That human weakness makes Hawkeye feel nearly *real*. I always am a little unsure when I'm watching him, making him the most interesting to me. \n\nAlso, I was a HUGE fan of Renner way before his Marvel appearances.

When everybody is ready, 1st Team rehearsal goes ahead and Chris is rigged. \n\nThey go through the action where he is yanked through the air repeatedly. \n\nThe three camera teams of Operator, 1st Assistant Camera, 2nd AC (guided by the DoP and supported by the DIT sitting in a tent with big monitors) are rehearsing the framing and focus. The grips are making sure the Scorpio camera crane and Libra remote head is following the action and the blue screen covers the full arc of the stunt. The dolly grips are checking if the tracks are straight and level and that they hit their marks. The gaffer and best-boy electric are tweaking lights and levels. The boom operator is making sure their mic doesn\u2019t enter frame or cast shadows, checks levels with the sound mixer. The VFX supervisor is checking the shot notes and animatic, checking in with the VFX data managers that the witness-cams are all running and ready to go. The script supervisor is checking continuity. Director is checking for performance. Standby props are making sure the sword and weapons are holding up. Makeup and hair check for shine and sweat. Costume department ensure the rigging doesn\u2019t pull or crush his wardrobe. Unit make sure everyone has coffee, refreshments and water. Craft services are waltzing around with trays of food. \n\nEverything coalesces around the 1st Assistant Director who calls \u201cFinal Checks\u201d. Makeup and wardrobe dart in and make minor adjustments to Chris\u2019 face and hair. The 1st AD calls \u201cRoll Sound\u201d and we\u2019re off. The slate is called and slate is clapped. The 1st AD calls \u201cAction!\u201d\n\nChris delivers his one line. He takes a swing, parries to the left then is pulled UP and OVER, landing gracefully then feinting to the side. The Director quietly says \u2018Cut\u2019 and the 3rd AD relays notes to the 1st AD. \n\nThere are 8 takes and the wire-work is pretty punishing.

Maybe with the right choices we won't need a generation of hardened badasses who chewed nails & charged trenches or helped fight a war with a baby slung on their back in the factories, if we make the right choices going forward.\n\nPersonally, I hope they stick with it, despite my discomfort, because to do anything less would be a disservice to Anthony & a lot of people who are eager to see more representation at the front of the Marvel universe.", "Yes!

I don't think that will happen and that's fine, but honestly think that could be better for him.", "You are just reading into my comments way to much. I understand that mantles are passed down often in the comics. But in my mind, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers is Captain America. RDJ as Tony Stark is Iron Man. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Anybody taking on those roles will not feel right to me because that is who the character is in my brain. Whether it is just an actor change or it is a passing of the torch in universe, it would be hard for me to see the next person as that character. That is the entire reason for everything I am saying.\n\nIt is probably in part because I was never as comic reader, so the whole mantle passing thing is not as familiar to me. It definitely is not about race in this situation. I think Sam is a great character who is a great fit to fill Steve's shoes. It is just hard to think of him as Captain America because he isn't Steve Rogers and he isn't Chris Evans. It would be the same thing if Bucky got the shield.

And I could be wrong, but I'm fairly confident that his strength is considered above human capability.", "I'm not positive as I haven't read many comics, but it wouldn't surprise me.

Doesn't take a lot out of him tbf but he definitely breaks a sweat.", "I know that's why I said he just pushed harder.

Giving her mjolnir doesn't make her Thor in my eyes.\n\nI havent read the comics regarding it though, but she DEFINITELY was not worthy of mjolnir so far, so im interested to see if/how that plays out in the mcu.", ">You are just reading into my comments way to much.\n\nI don't think so. I just want to poke holes here and to get you (and others) to reflect. This kind of situation is very much that passive racism that just permeates one's existence in the US. \n\nI am very guilty of this myself. It was a discussion about hair usage that finally \"clicked\" for me. The first part was shaving in the military, sure clean shaven has it's importance and can ostensibly make sense as a requirement for that reason. But what it does is creates a major problem for black soldiers. There is a legit reason that so many black men have beards, and that's because the curliness of the hair causes a stupid amount of ingrown hairs. The bumps are awful, noticeable, and painful.\n\nI think you did a good job of reflecting. That reasoning is a lot more specific than just \"it feels weird,\" which is how people tend say \"I don't want a black Captain America\" without saying it.\n\nHonestly, the Actor as Alter-Ego as Super Hero link and deep connection was not something I really considered here. I would quibble with those examples though; Logan is \"The Wolverine\" and there's nothing really for him to \"pass down,\" right? It's not like \"The Wolverine\" is a symbol of anything meaningful, it's not like he's an icon that people look up to, and with the mutants, generally their ability is fundamentally tied to their name. It's less a \"mantle\" and more a nickname.\n\nIron Man could be a mantle, but even then, with the movies, we have the inextricability of RDJ's line \"I am Iron Man.\" Plus you already have him building suits for others and giving them other names. \n\nBut... Captain America was supposed to be an idea, right? He was your All-American Every-Man With Good Morals who was given the opportunity to be a **Hero**. While you might see something essential about the person Steve Rogers being Captain America, I view Steve Rogers as more the embodiment of the ideal and with that in mind, I don't see why Sam Wilson isn't just as great a man behind the mask as Steve Rogers.\n\n\nReally though, please do not really take this as me trying to call you a bad person or anything like that. It just felt like an opportunity to engage with some implicit biases.\n\nETA: I def was pretty harsh in my initial comment, because I just saw that entire argument played out when Sam took over the shield in the comics, and I had a bit of a flash-back."], "category": "top"}

Even a film like TWS where there's realistic themes and elements, it's not all like that and it doesn't try to be. It's still very sci-fi and larger than life.\n\nSo it annoys me when people crap on Sam's CA outfit with like \"Why isn't his head covered?\" or whatever. I dunno, same reason it hasn't been this whole time? Same reason Nat and Hawkeye go into battle without helmets? Bucky doesn't have a helmet and he may get shot in the head too.", "> one of Cyclops' lesser known support traits to go with his main laser sight is exactly that, inate capability to calculate his aim/angles\n\nI get the angles thing (it's actually a very good analogy for Cap in this case) but he wouldn't need a special power for aiming, would he? He'd know he'd hit anything he was looking directly at.\n\nIt's also why I think it's completely unbelievable when someone can dodge eye laser. If the user can look at you, you dead. Like when Batman dodges Super's laserbeam in Batman v. Superman. As realistic as someone having the time to jump and catch a bullet imo.", "> I believe Cap also got some mental boosts that help him with very capable aim and mental calculations for things like bouncing the shield off things exactly right.\n\nI always took the serum as being the reason he could use the shield, a mixture of the strength to throw a big metal disc, and the split second calculations to bounce it perfectly. \n\nBut now a regular soldier both has the power to throw it, and the mental agility to bounce it. Makes the serum honestly feel kind of pointless, unless we're saying the reason Cap needed it was because he was physically incapable of becoming fit without it, hmm.", "They were doing pretty light tosses back and forth.\n\nI could play a friendly game of catch with my buddy with a baseball but I'm not throwing it across the plate at 98 miles an hour.\n\nOne scenario he's playing, the other is him getting into his 'A game'.", "Hey I can throw a tomahawk but if I tried the classic Russian tomahawk backflip throw....", "Valid point.  *Technically* Cap without the shield ended with half the universe dusted.", "I mean really Iron Man should have used the shield then since it was in his possession.

Torres showed up in the last episode, he didn't disappear.", "He showed up, it sas just a teaser of whats coming for those who know", "There were only 6 episodes, that's almost half the show, what are you even talking about?", "I did. That's how I know that Torres isn't the new Falcon yet.", "They're getting me to subscribe, and I've told others to subscribe and watch.\n\nUsually I'm against the whole separation of powers when it comes to streaming, like if it's not on hulu, netflix, or amazon I just don't watch it because anymore and I'm basically paying for cable again. But with the amount of stuff and quality of their new shows, I've got no problem giving them my money since they seem to actually be working for it and not strictly leaching things for their own payday.\n\nI hope it's sustainable, I didn't think I'd ever get over the loss of marvel shows on netflix, but here we are and I'm happy.", "Why is Torres headlining unlikely?

That in itself is a crazy good power to have. Sam can't do some of what Steve could, but Sam can do a lot of things Steve couldn't too.\n\nHe shows this in his first outing. End of CATWS he stops two of the murderplanes and Steve handles the final one.\n\nI think ultimately, it's just different in terms of abilities. Even before the show, what truly made CA, CA, was who they are and why they do it. It's not too diff to Iron Man. Tony wasn't IM because he had the suit, others have super suits, enemies have had super suits. IM was IM because of Tony. Anyone who steps into a role similar him will need Tony things as much as IM things about them.\n\nArguably, the most heroic things about Steve and Tony had more to do with them as a person rather than their superpowers.\n\nSam's got that covered. He just has to find his own ways to handle things physically. And really, there's threats he'll be able to handle that Steve never could. He has to fight differently. In that way, he's still his own hero. He's always going to have to be Sam's version of CA. And that's a good thing. It'd be shit if Sam just became CA2.0.

Yes, I said I considered it unlikely too, but I could at least hypothetically see a path forward where Sam gets a standalone or two as Captain America, an appearance in that capacity in an Avengers movie or something, and then once they've told some of those stories they change it up again. Maybe Bucky takes up the shield, maybe Steve comes back, who knows.

It instantly ties into the greater MCU world and other properties\n- For a MCU movie, the first 2 acts were pretty isolated (the vault and desert).

For me it was a solid 7/10! Can sneak up to a 7.5!\n\nIt i indeed a breath of fresh air in the MCU, and the direct setup for the next movie gave me \"good ol' MCU vibes\"!\n\nI will say this. I do think the movie and the plot was predictable. No big surprise twists in my opinion. But unlike other MCU movies with a predictable plot, it was well-written and well-executed. And yet, while the plot was predictable, it sticks the landing. And it never went astray from the plot either. It was one smooth line from start to finish, with perfect pacing.\n\nThe scene where Bucky is going after them, was my first moment of feeling the MCU is back. That scene, for some reason, stood out for me, gave me goosebumps and made me think \"we are so back!\"\n\nClearly, Yelena and Bob are the main characters. And they execute it so well. The dynamic between the 2 of them, and also between them and the rest of the team for that matter, is great. What I slightly missed though, was a trip into the void, or into the shadows, with Red Guardian, Bucky and Ghost as well. We only have that brief moment there with Yelena and Walker. They could easily have added 10-15 minutes extra there, without it hurting the movie.\n\nNow, I did mention the plot was predictable without surprises. Yet, with that said, there was a bit of a surprising jump scare moment for me, in the scene where Yelena find Bob in the void. That took me by surprise.\n\nThe cherry on top of the cake was the end credit scene. That was hype. At first I found the whole \"Cap does not approve (of them being the Avengers), and he will form his own team\" a bit lame. Especially given his relation with Bucky. They could just join forces. But after thinking about it, it makes sense that Cap, with his moral and ethics, would not approve of them being the Avengers, sort of formed by a corrupt Valentina, also even though his friend is part of the team.", "That was a lot of fun!!

We are so lucky to live in a time when Florence Pugh can headline a $200 million dollar summer blockbuster.\n\n _Super_ by the numbers plot and beats until it goes places I didn\u2019t expect for this movie, and their take on doing \u2018evil superman\u2019 so late to the general audience after The Boys and Invincible was refreshing. Wasn\u2019t too jazzed about Sentry being Sentry in name only, but their original take on The Void was excellent, and I\u2019m hoping we see it again.\n\nAbsolutely surreal to end this movie with the Avengers score and semi-committing to the name with \u201cThe New Avengers will return.\u201d Even more surreal they\u2019re all suited up and hanging out in Avengers Tower and monitoring space activity.

It captured my attention right away.\n\n\nIt was funny, it was sad, it was engaging.

Sentry's whole thing was endearing and I liked seeing how his story develop.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Yelena and Sentry were the stand-outs, Walker surprised me a lot and I was much more engaged with him than in \"Falcon and the Winter Soldier\". I can't even remember if he was like this in that but I loved it.\u00a0\n\n\nI had some disappointments:\u00a0\n- I wish we got to see the others confront their past before meeting up with Yelena. They could've skipped Bucky, but it would've been nice to see Red Guardian, John Walker, and Ghost overcome their individual traumas.\u00a0\n- Perhaps the inverse of Walker, Ghost didn't do as much as I was hoping. While she did help the team in several BIG ways, I didn't FEEL like I got to know her as much as the rest. What makes her a loser, why is she working with Val, etc. A shame as I came in hoping to see her fleshed out only to feel like I knew her the least out of everyone. It makes me wish the movie was 10-15 minutes longer just to give her and the others a bit more.\n- Ending felt a tad rushed/anticlimactic.

Best MCU movie for a while. I will see if F4 can match up to it.\n\nThe script is great .. actually means something rather than just have another world-ending CGI horde to fight.

Instead of \"No, he was holding me down while that Ginger Bitch was gonna stab me in the Heart and my best friend gave his life to protect me. Then that Terrorist tried to escape into a crowd of innocent people and threw a concrete Water Fountain at me, so I did literally what I was sent their to do\" That really pissed me off, but other than that yeah really good movie had a lot of fun.", "Taskmaster deserved better. Almost pointless and insulting to even include her in the film only to kill her off so quickly and unceremoniously.\n\nApart from that, fucking fantastic and I\u2019m very excited for the next two years and beyond.", "I like how they still maintained the ambiguity with Walker and how much he is worthy of being Captain America. I mean, sure, dude is still an asshole and isn\u2019t really worthy of getting into Steve Roger's shoes. But they also show that his biggest regret in his entire life is neglecting his family after his fall from grace. Even after all the shitty things he knows he did in the military, that is the thing he is most regretful about. He really is the perfect soldier and maybe under different circumstances, he could have been a good man too, considering he has some decent core values.\n\n\nI'm a little disappointed with how the final conflict is resolved. Sure, the movie definitely build upto it with all the characters struggling with their actions and life choices, especially yelena getting a complete arc around that. It is a satisfying ending. But I was hoping the team would get their lick back after getting destroyed by the sentry during their first attempt. The group's entry exit shots in the elevator made it seem like they could take him down if they came up with a plan instead of fighting him head-on. After all, they do have ghost with phasing powers, which is one the biggest hax ability a superhero can have.\n\nThey have great chemistry, but imo they didn't get a definitive \"they are a team now\" moment. The civilians' protection scene doesn't count. With their powers, they could have done what they did even if they were not a team and ghost as a character is entirely replaceable if not for her convenient power which is pretty useful in the first act.\n\nMaybe they could have helped each other when they are trying get deeper into the void to finally get to the place where bob is, which could fit into overall themes of fighting loneliness. They did do a version of it when Yelena alone was struggling with Bob's psyche fighting back and rest of the team coming to help. But learning about each other's trauma and actually helping each other get out of it would have strengthened their bonds immensely.\n\n\nAlso, does sentry have those psychic powers in comics, too, or did the writers give him those powers in the movie for the story they want to tell. I like the implication that the entire population of New York also went through that \"reliving your worst trauma\" moment while they were sucked into the void.", "They really hammered home that these were all super soldiers haha.

The scene where everyone jumped into action to save people after the crane fell was *great* - it reminded me of the first *Avengers*. I was worried that I might find Red Guardian annoying, but he bought much needed levity when the film needed it. Bob was a great character too.\n\nI wish that there was more meat to Ghost\u2019s role, though - like catching up with how life has been since *Ant-Man and the Wasp*. Her role on the roster could have been replaced with anyone, to be honest.\n\nThe writing felt jumbled. I wish there had actually been a proper resolution to the Valentina impeachment storyline, and Bucky trying to convince her aide to testify against her. It could be argued that Yelena now having power over Val is a worse ending for her, but I think the narrative needed a bit more of a meaty resolution - like, maybe her aid interrupting the press conference to reveal the truth. There was also that line about Bucky only being Senator for less than half a term - was that just a threat? Because otherwise, it doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAn argument can also be made that the film could have committed more to the psychological thriller angle and just gone for an R-rating - to be honest, I\u2019m surprised that the film wasn\u2019t a 15 here in the UK.\n\nIt was funny how much the film just disrespected Taskmaster. Killing her in like the first 10 minutes or so, and not even to showcase The Void or anything - just popped in the head by Ghost.\n\nThe *Fantastic Four* themed IMAX intro was a cute touch.

I worried Marvel was going for their own Suicide Squad with a \u201cbad people gone good\u201d setup, which, to me, would be tricky, since most of these characters were never true villains to begin with. Maybe Walker nears that line, but even he was mostly just misguided with some major flaws and errors in TFATWS.\n\nThankfully, the movie does none of that. They\u2019re just a bunch of misfits who cross paths by chance, and it actually works pretty well. The story has plenty of depth and handles mental health in a very classy way that still fits within the MCU. They also dive into character development, which is something I really missed in recent MCU movies (movies, specifically). Yes, the movie is slow at times, but it helped connecting with the characters, which I really appreciated.\n\nThe action is solid. I was hoping for more grounded choreography like in TWS, but I\u2019ve accepted that\u2019s probably a thing of the past. Still, what we got worked well enough.\n\nYelena and Val were definite standouts for me, and I thought Sentry was handled perfectly. It felt like a great comic-to-screen interpretation.\n\nTwo gripes:\n\n1. Taskmaster had a good opening, with an actual line, that hinted at a bigger presence or some form of redemption/justification, but then... nope.\n2. Don't know if this is a hot take, but I'm not a fan of Red Guardian\u2019s portrayal. Wasn't in Black Widow to begin with and they extended it in this movie. The goofy dad shtick felt off and clashed with the rest of the movie\u2019s more serious tone. I get that his angle within the mental health theme is an inferiority complex, combined with family trauma, but I think there are better, more subtle(?) ways to handle those aspects. I love Harbour, but it just doesn't land for me.\n\nAll in all, I absolutely had a blast with this movie, and I finally hit a point where I'm excited again for what Marvel brings next!\n\nBonus point: they actually save common civilians! I can't remember the last time where the MCU had to go out of their way to show that the heroes are actually doing... you know, hero stuff.", "Amazing movie but I kinda wish they made Taskmaster more of a character instead of just killing her.

Sets the tone right off the bat.\n\nI wish Taskmaster had more to do. I understand why; too OP and she has a very similar backstory to Yelena.

I was rooting for Bob the whole time", "THEY FOUGHT THANOS\n\nTHEY FOUGHT ULTRON\n\nNOW THEY FACE THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET.... MENTAL HEALTH", "Yes! Sentry fighting with his \"dark side\" was such an amazing way to visualize the internal struggle of a depressed person still battling their own past. And they made the whole movie about these issues, all cleverly leading to the moral of the story that you're never alone, there are always people ready to listen to you and be there for you. Even if they're not your friends or family, it can be a random group of people with similar problems that can help you feel understood. Thunderbolts weren't a superhero team, they were a group therapy meeting. And it felt so honest, like it's not a shoehorned obligatory moral. I cried, I felt understood, I went home and hugged my partner and talked about my past. Not for the first time, but it's great to let your emotions out every time you feel the need to talk and to feel that someone's listening and you never have to be alone with your mind. Beautiful movie.\n\nBTW it's funny to keep seeing each other from time to time in the Reddit comments after all these years, mister K.", "Also I like that he didn\u2019t beat it so much as got better at managing it.

However, this movie does feature a team who previously appeared in different properties.\n\nThunderbolts\\* is somewhat set up as the equivalent of the first Avengers for this group of characters. So to fully understand who the characters are, here are the movies/shows you might need to watch:\n\n* **Yelena (a Black Widow)** \\- Black Widow (movie) / Hawkeye (TV Show)\n* **Red Guardian** \\- Black Widow\n* **US Agent -** Falcon and Winter Soldier (TV show)\n* **Ghost -** Antman and the Wasp (movie)\n* **Taskmaster -** Black widow\n* **Bucky -** Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Falcon and Winter Soldier, Captain America: Brave New World\n\nAnother important character seems to be **Fontaine** but she has no properties dedicated to her. She does however appear in **Black Panther: Wakanda Forever**, **Black Widow**, and **FATWS**.\n\nIf you don't have time to do that, here are some options.\n\n**Least Time Investment:**\n\n>Here's a recap video kindly made by [Man Of Recaps](https://youtu.be/sUjgDKFbNWo)! \n\n**Medium Time Investment:**  \n\n\n>To get an overview of the characters (and assuming you watched some pre-Endgame content), FATWS, Black Widow, and Antman and the Wasp are enough. \n\nFor the **\"Most Time Investment\"**, please refer to the list by characters above.\n\n# What powers do the characters have?\n\nSpoiler tagged if you didn't watch the properties defined above\n\n* **Yelena -** >!Went through the same Red Room training as Natasha (Black Widow).!<\n* **Red Guardian -** >!Has a version of the super soldier serum created by the Soviet Union!<\n* **US Agent -** >!Super soldier serum enhancement and military training!<\n* **Ghost -** >!Invisibility, intangibility, and enhanced strength thanks to exposure to Quantum energy!<\n* **Taskmaster -** >!Red Room training and able to replicate any fighting style she encounters!<\n* **Bucky -** Super soldier serum enhancement, military training, and metal arm\n\n# Where does this movie fit in the timeline?\n\n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this movie will take place in 2027 (so not long after Captain America: Brave New World).", "author": "Void_Warden", "upvotes": 132, "postID": "1k4bksa", "postImage": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1k4bksa/thunderbolts_spoilerfree_recap_faq/", "postUrl": "/r/marvelstudios/comments/1k4bksa/thunderbolts_spoilerfree_recap_faq/", "comments": [], "category": "hot", "linkTitle": "Too Many Requests"}

You can give RDJ $80M but can't match renner's season 1 salary? Whatever, Disney.", "So disheartened to hear this. I understand Disney is trying to lower the cost of the D+ productions...but they really missed an opportunity here. \n\nJeremy is widely lovely, Clint even more so and the first season was generally well received.\n\nThe whole incident meant that the show would have received an incredible amount of extra publicity and would have attracted interest beyond the Marvel aficionados.", "Good on him.

Easy to brush off?\n\nAlso, how did audiences respond to the tone of Iron Man?

However I had no idea it would become what it did, just figured it was a cool setup for a sequel, and in the next movie we might get another hero or two added.\n\nSo happy with how big and crazy it's become!", "you have to put yourself in that time period.  Spiderman 3 and Xmen 3 had come out and really didnt live up to the hype.  Superman returns wasn't all that.  FF, daredevil were pretty cheesy.  the Ang Lee Hulk wasn't that great either.  though we did have a sleeper in batman begins, it sort of flew under the radar.  Comic movies weren't at their high point.  All the goodwill that was created with Spiderman 1/2 and Xmen 1/2 had gone.\n\nBut then 2008 hit, and it wasn't only Iron Man...but also the Dark Knight and the incredible hulk.  Dark Knight was definitely the movie of the 3 that got most of the initial hype.  its batman and the Joker and there had been so much talk about Ledgers Joker and what he put into the role..deservingly so.  Iron man at this point was just a b level marvel comic figure no one wanted to license the rights too...and hulk, people weren't to sure about given the last hulk movie.  So no one really predicted Iron Man was going to be as good or as big as it got.  Especially coming from Jon Favreau who at the time was known cause of swingers, really didnt have big budget blockbuster experience.  Shit even Robert Downey Jr wasn't the name he is now.  But then Iron man came out...and it was freaking great.  It blew up in the theaters.  They pulled the whole Samuel L jackson thing at the end....and then the whole avengers thing got solidified a month later as downey showed up in Hulk.  It didn't take long for people to realize what a big deal Iron Man was and this was beginning of something big.  My wildest dreams couldn't imagine how far they'd go down the marvel rabbit hole though.  i remember thinking...wow an avengers movie with multiple hero's?  Unheard of!  The full breadth of what marvel was about to do though i dont think really occured too many, until the end of avengers 1 when we saw Thanos face......and even then people were skeptical.....", "Iron man was my favorite hero growing up. He was there, but on the periphery. I had a couple comics nothing crazy. So I couldn\u2019t believe he was getting a movie. And with washed Robert Downey jr? \n\nAnd I loved the movie. But it wasn\u2019t anything revolutionary. It was just a good well done fun movie.", "Went opening night. Went in fairly cold, I probably saw one of the trailers. Despite being a lifelong superhero fan, I wasn't super excited. I knew about Iron Man from the 90s animated series and thought he was a cool enough character, but it wasn't like he was Batman or anything. I remembering thinking about how they're making C-level characters into movies now.\n\nAnyway, I thought the movie was quite enjoyable. Credits rolled and I think I heard someone say \"Hang on, there's something after the credits\" so I stayed put. Post-credits used to just be a blooper reel or some joke. Nothing important, but I was for whatever it was.\n\nMan, when I heard Sam Jackson's voice, my heart started to race. First of all, it was Samuel L. Jackson! Second, when I saw him in the eye patch, I knew he was Nick Fury, which was awesome. So far, this post-credits scene was pretty cool with a Nick Fury cameo. But when he mentioned, the Avengers Initiative, I think my brain short-circuited. Like I couldn't comprehend that I had just heard that. \"An Avengers movie? No way. They can't do that. Can they? It's just a tease that will be forgotten in Iron Man 2\" The idea of team-up movies had been teased for years but they never happened. The closest we ever got was Bruce Wayne mentioning Metropolis in Batman Forever. But this? This could be real. I was absolutely speechless but still in disbelief. It was only the next day that I heard Marvel was actually going to do it and that Tony would appear in The Incredible Hulk.\n\nSo in short, the experience quickly went from 'just another superhero movie' to \"Ok, I'm having a good time\" to mind blowing.", "Soph in college. Midnight release. Saw it with my roommates. Zero expectations. No comic book background really other than playing video games with marvel superheroes like marvel vs capcom 2 and the side scrolling xmen games. I had seen the saturday morning cartoons from the 90s and watched all the old lou Ferrigno hulk tv shows. I was blown away. Everyone in the theater loved it. It was packed (theater near tOSU campus). People laughed people cheered. \n\nI was really looking forward to the incredible hulk movie that was coming out after seeing this movie. \n\nIron Man was a memorable movie, so much so that I was interested in seeing sequel and Thor and the rest of em.. dont think ive missed a marvel movie on release ever.", "I turned to my wife after it was over and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe they did it.\u201d", "It was a huge payoff for me.  Iron Man has been my favorite Marvel since I was a kid.  I remember first hearing he was getting a film around the time the first Raimi Spider-Man movie came out.  The six or seven year wait that followed proved to be worth it.", "I was happy with the film and, at the time, compared it to the Nolan Batman trilogy in terms of cinema taking a comic book character seriously. Then, the idea of comic book characters (teased) interacting on screen and crossing over was insane. But I had no idea at the time what was in the eventual pipeline. I was so excited just for the prospect of two characters interacting. Never in my wildest imagination did I think it would culminate to something like Endgame.", "I was sold immediately, I still remember what it felt like to see that end credit scene take place. Just hearing the word 'Avengers' on screen after watching Iron Man be a great film... it was electric. \n\nIt was also the summer of The Dark Knight, and I remember having conversations at the time with my friends about how The Dark Knight was a better movie, but Iron Man was going to be the much more important movie to come out that summer. \n\nLogic being, The Dark Knight felt like a culmination of a super hero movie conceit of 'making it real', whereas Iron Man introduced the concept of not being embarrassed by being from a comic book... that confidence set the framework for the whole damn thing.\n\nOf course now a days thats not new or fresh, so it might seem quaint in retrospect... but you could see on day one (if you cared to look) that comic book storytelling was about to change for the better.", "I liked it a lot, saw it the next day, then realized Incredible Hulk probably tied in too.  Then that came out and it was clear something amazing was taking shape.  I had never thought much of Tony Stark I was always more into when he was in the suit and Thor reading comics in the 90s.  RDJ gave Tony life.  Without his portrayal in that movie we wouldn\u2019t be talking about it 17 years later much less have the biggest movie universe/franchise in cinematic history still going.", "It was really fun and a lot better then people expected it to be, a lot of people who were not usually into those kinds of movies really liked it too.  but honestly no one saw the MCU becoming what it was today", "I was 14, and went to see it on a whim with a couple of friends. I was *not* a comic reader at all and expected it to be just another superhero movie, none of which had ever really hooked me before. But wow, I LOVED it. I remember being mind blown by the way it ended, with Tony saying \u201cI am Iron Man,\u201d because I had never seen a superhero movie where the superhero didn\u2019t have a secret identity, and I remember thinking it was *so* freaking cool that he owned up to it. My friends and I all walked out of the theater babbling about how good it was and doing impressions of that last line, haha. Didn\u2019t know anything about the avengers at all, but I was super intrigued by the prospect of more. It was a game changer of a movie for me!", "Was amazing", "In all honesty I rolled my eyes at it. Iron Man was not a fan favorite when I was growing up reading comics. He seemed very one dimensional as a character. Drunk rich guy has cool toys. Then I saw the magic of the movie. It was well done. It made me care about Tony Stark. I saw the potential of setting up a \u201cmade for our time\u201d Avengers going forward. I rewatch it every so often to try and relive that sense of surprise and \u201cwhat could they do with this\u201d feeling. So, I loved it.", "I was 8 years old and I loved it, my dad and I didn\u2019t know about the post credit scenes until we get to Iron Man 2. I also saw Hulk in theaters and didn\u2019t know it was connected due to also not knowing about post credit scenes. When we got to Iron Man 2 and the Avengers were name dropped again my dad thought it was a reference to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)). Needless to say we were pretty shocked when the Avengers came together it was an actual surprise when that movie was announced, I miss being a child with no regular internet access anymore, my young ignorance made the experience better. \n\nI really grew up with the MCU, saw every single movie in theaters until Far From Home, that broke my streak and it\u2019s been inconsistent since but I am seeing Thunderbolts tonight and this post was a fun walk back down memory lane for the MCU and myself.", "Movie came out the same year as The Dark Knight, so unfortunately didn't get the hype out deserves", "The heart -- no pun intended -- of the movie for me was scene where Pepper helps Tony fix the pacemaker he has embedded when he's laying on the table in his lab. It's funny and dramatic at the same time.  That scene was the first time where I felt like I was seeing the kind of real world vibe that I grew up seeing in Marvel comics in the Seventies. I saw the film on the Thursday before opening and I don't think it was sold out either. But audience loved it and barely anyone knew to stick around for the Sam Jackson scene post credits.", "It was goddamn awesome.   Stark's time in the cave elevated it over a lot of similar movies of the era.   On top of that I saw it with my dad who normally wouldn't be into superhero stuff but RDJ's machismo and \"hot rod\" car aesthetic to how he builds the suits really appealed to him so he loved it.   \"Ya knew he wouldn't stick to the script!\" was his words coming out of the theatre\n\nMeanwhile, while I didn't catch what Coulson was saying every time he says who he works for throughout the movie, I DEFINITELY knew what he meant when he abbreviated it to SHIELD at the end and I ABSOLUTELY knew who Sam Jackson was, so it was all I could talk about on our walk back to the car.  \n\n  \nI was SO hype.  I never imagined it would pay off as well as it does later on but damn was that a good movie.", "I was 13, incredibly hyped, but did not stay after the credits. One of my friends asked if I\u2019d seen the post credits scene a few day later and I had not because that wasn\u2019t a standard thing back then. I didn\u2019t see Nick Fury until it came out on dvd.", "It was honestly underwhelming. The only reason it was so well received was because of how low the bar was for superhero movies at that time. Honestly if Iron Man had come out after the Dark Knight instead of two months before it I don't think it would have been as big of a hit as it was.", "It was very good, and a win for comic book movies and Marvel Studios. Its success was vital to getting the MCU truly off the ground.\n\nBut this was also the summer The Dark Knight came out. Arguably a better and more important film.\n\nThis flipped when Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises came out in 2012.\u00a0", "> What was it like?\n\nIt was an enjoyable superhero flick. RDJ felt like he was born to play Tony Stark. To top it off, there was an extra credit scene too?!?\n\n> What were your thoughts?\n\nI saw this movie with a few of my former Best Buy coworkers (a number of us went to see comic book movies when they came out), and in comparison to *X-Men: The Last Stand* and *Spider-Man 3*, we were excited about what would come next, or to put it another way, we were looking forward to whatever was next. That was not a sentiment I had after either of the other movies. That was more like: if they put out another one, I will  probably watch it, but I'm not prioritizing it, I'll see it when I see it.", "At the time I thought it was the best superhero movie of all time.", "During its time, the special effects were amazing!", "Honestly, it was a good fun movie. Something fresh, quite different. But at that point you still dont know it was the start of something big. At that point, it was a fun time. Even acter Fury appeared in the credits, everybody was asking what was that. what is the Avengers. nobody knows at that point exactly what that is or what it entails. It was only after the hype built up on the other OG members that it started to sink in of what this will lead to.", "My mind was blown by the entire movie and double blown by the after credits scene. I was absolutely ecstatic about the future of Marvel movies. \n\nI'm so grateful some random stranger walked past me as I was entering the theater and told to stay through the credits. It was a once in a lifetime experience that I'll never forget.", "My mind was blown by the entire movie and double blown by the after credits scene. I was absolutely ecstatic about the future of Marvel movies. \n\nI'm so grateful some random stranger walked past me as I was entering the theater and told to stay through the credits. It was a once in a lifetime experience that I'll never forget.", "I really enjoyed it. I remember seeing it quite well. I thought it was a great film. Same year as the Dark Knight and I saw that 3 times. I remember getting a little bored of the X Men films so Iron Man was quite refreshing. \n\nOf course the post credit scene was great.\n\nI also saw Iron Man 2 in cinemas and thought it completely boring lol.", "MCU fans didn't exist in 2008. There were general Marvel fans who would see it and general audiences because it looked good, but what happened was the movie was a huge breath of fresh air that was just different. The average person may not even consider it a superhero movie and word of mouth spread like wildfire. The post-credit scene was a huge surprise and is what got people really discussing the possibility of an Avengers movie even being able to work, nobody really expected a universe to come from it which is why Thanos being hinted in Avengers itself was such a huge surprise, because it meant there was more to come.\n\nPeople were gasping when Nick Fury mentioned other heroes. Nobody had the concept of rights in their mind so everyone naturally thought that meant any other Marvel hero you had seen onscreen before.\n\nI distinctly remember hearing people say Iron Man was their new favorite superhero. These weren't comic readers or anything, just general audiences who consumed superhero movies from time to time. They knew about your Supermans, Batmans, Spider-Man and the X-Men and maybe a few of the stuff that dropped between the early to mid-2000s. Iron Man was an instant hit. It was a time of different movie culture. Everyone was asking other people if they had seen it and if you hadn't, they were saying you should.", "I really enjoyed it.  It was presented in such a matter-of-fact way that it felt fresh.  It wasn't as stylized as the Raimi Spider-Man movies, or as muted as the X-Men movies.  The suit was colorful and seemed tactile, and they trusted themselves to show it in action in broad daylight.  The cast was perfect too.  It felt like a breath of fresh air.", "I actually just happened to see it in theater because my son was 10 years old at the time and loved superhero movies, so I saw a lot of them because of him. I preferred Iron Man and the X-Men movies to many of the others(Transformers, G.I. Joe, Batman, etc.), but I wouldn\u2019t have had any idea that it would be become what we have today.", "My thoughts were mostly shock. Shock that they took a B-level character and made such a great film out of it, shock that so many other people seemed to love it, and shock that it did so well at the box office. Those feelings of shock soon after became elation. As a Marvel fan I was glad to see another really good Marvel comic book adaptation and just see it doing so well.", "I thought \"Ah ok - that was a bit better than it had any right to be, good stuff\"\n\nBut just assumed it was a standalone thing.\n\nMost people were the same. Minimal fanfare.", "Jesus Christ am I this old that there are redditors that don\u2019t remember this movie in theaters?\n\nI went in knowing very little about Iron Man or Avengers. I was always more of an X-Men fan growing up because of the animated series in the 90s. I went in thinking it would be just another superhero movie like the early 2000s Fantastic Four - fun, but ultimately forgettable. For me, it was basically an appetizer ahead of The Dark Knight which I was super pumped about that summer. I came out thinking Iron Man was cool as fuck and super excited for what would come next following the extra credit scene with Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. There was also a good amount of buzz on some old movie blogs I followed about a cool post-credit scene, that\u2019s why I stayed to watch it. we take those post-credit scenes for granted now but back then that scene was pretty revolutionary. I had no idea it would become the most successful shared movie universe in history. RDJ\u2019s comeback was also great because I basically only remembered him from his drug convictions.", "I wonder how it even got around that there was a post-credits scene, I can't imagine most people stayed through the entire credits.", "You gotta keep in mind, it came out the same summer as The Dark Knight...so THAT was the movie everyone was talking about that year. \n\nAlso, people were shocked that they gave the role to RDJ, who wasn't in the best position at the time... But still, I consider that movie a masterpiece in terms of a superhero movie. His chemistry with Paltrow was great and the post credit scene I didn't see until my 2nd time seeing it, since friends told me I missed it the first time.\n\nWho knew we'd be here now...", "I was a kid, but it still felt special. The cast and its chemistry, the snappy dialogue, the well-sprinkled humor, the pretty airtight plot. In light of movies like Spider-Man 3, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and X-Men: The Last Stand, Iron Man felt clean and focused. It knew when to go loud and when to go quiet. when to go tense and when to go light-hearted. Just like how RDJ's Tony felt earnest, so did the film.\n\nI went in as a comic fan, but I still had relatively limited knowledge of the wider Marvel Universe beyond Spider-Man. I did like Iron Man, but I hadn't had the chance to consume more media featuring him, so the movie was a big thing in consolidating my love for the character. By the time Iron Man 2 came out, Tony had become my main man.\n\nA funny story from my screeing of the movie is that I knew there was a post-credits scene featuring Nick Fury from reports on the internet, but I didn't know the details. I stayed with my father and one other group of people as the credits rolled. However, since post-credit scenes weren't a widespread phenomena, the guys at the projector pulled the film before we reached it. I overhead that other group of people complain to the usher, but there was not much to be done, so I had to look up a camrip on YouTube after coming back home.", "For context, I was in my early 40s and read mostly Avengers comic as a kid and into High School (late 80s-early 90s). \n\nI was excited to see the Dolph Lungren Punisher and the Salinger Captain America movies. \n\nI took one of my kids to see the movie and when I got home, I told my wife it was the comic book movie I had been waiting for since I was 12. \n\nThe thicket agent mentioned there was a post credit scene, but gave no spoilers. \n\nWhen Sam Jackson stepped out from the shadows I was mother fucking (pun intended) floored! \n\nI was super hyped, and doubtful that they could pull of an Avengers movie that had 5-7 super heroes in it.", "As a big movie buff and comic book fan, it was the coolest thing.\n\nI was born in 1980, so I grew up with awesome Superman movies and Batman movies, but anything outside of that was typically garbage until things like The Crow and Blade came around.\n\nHoward the Duck, Spawn, Swamp Thing, Captain America, etc just a bunch of crab.\n\nThe best action movies were typically led by an action star like Arnold, or Stallone, or Van Damme, etc. \n\nBut as the millennium was coming, those stars were disappearing.\n\nAnd once The Matrix came out, the action genre changed completely.\n\nRobert Downey Jr was considered to be a very sad tale of a total waste of talent due to drugs and alcohol.\n\nWe all really liked seeing him in his movies, but we saw so much of him in mugshots and court proceedings that the aura went away, and he kinda just disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, superhero movies started getting really good. X-Men, Spider-man, Batman Begins, just some really cool content that got us excited to see where they go from here. \n\nI would say that outside of Nolan's first 2 Batman movies, most of these movies still had a bit of cringe to them in places. They were getting better, some were even great, but there was still potential for more.\n\nAnd that's why seeing Iron Man was such an amazing experience. I didn't know a comic book movie could be that fun and enjoyable and still be really cool at the same time.\n\nSeeing RDJ look clean, confident, and giving a knock out performance was such an awesome come back feeling. We always wanted to be on that guy's side.\n\nI remember feeling like I was out of breath by the time that movie was done, it was so exciting.\n\nAnd then, \"The Avengers Initative\" comment was like an explosion on top of this already exhilarating experience.\n\n\"OH MY GAWWWD!!!\" Lol, we were so excited.", "The only thing I knew Iron Man from was  fromMarvel vs Capcom 2, but I loved that game so I was down to see what kind of story he had.\n\nImmediately it was great to see a character that's not your typical hero and starts off as a rich selfish playboy. The redemption arc was great, and RDJ had so much charisma in the role.\n\nI think a lot of people missed the post credits scene as it wasn't really a thing back then, so a lot of people were surprised to learn online there was a scene teasing the Avengers.", "I was a kid and absolutely loved it. Hadn't read a single comic, didn't know the character, and all the high tech billionaire genius explosions badassery hyped me up a lot. The cave, the suit ups. Went right back for Iron Man 2 and 3", "I loved it but more about being pumped that they nailed the vibe and tone for a comic movie. Even as a kid aside from everyone\u2019s favorites like Spider-Man 1& 2 and x2. I never liked  how Sony and fox did their super hero movies. They change everything cool and keep everything that doesn\u2019t work. \n\nI was like THIS is how you make a comic movie.", "I was 13 and just remember thinking \u201coh this is sick, hopefully they make this a trilogy like they did with Spider-Man, it would be cool to see more of this character\u201d", "Was up all night writing my last term paper freshman year of college. Turned it in and took the bus to the mall to see the 9am show. I remember it was so early there was nobody at the ticket booth or snack bar, i might have just walked straight in without paying. Went back to campus, slept all day and woke up to go to a beer pong tournament.\n\nHilarious seeing all the youngsters on here thinking superhero movie fan culture is a recent thing, there was enormous hype for this movie and it was well known that Samuel L showed up at the end way ahead of release. Thought the movie was fun but The Dark Knight was THE event of the year, seeing the midnight show that summer is a top 5 moviegoing experience of my life.", "We got a free early screening. I went with my wife and friend from work who was a big comic book fan. \nWe loved it. He said it was the best comic book adaptation he had ever seen. \n\nWe mostly went because we loved Jon Favreaus other movies and thought he would do something interesting.", "I was certainly excited but at the time, it felt like any other Marvel movie. I remember seeing it in the theater and it was a sold out showing. But then the news came out about the post-credits scene and the Avengers Initiative, I actually went and saw it again just to see that extra scene! I thought it was a fun Easter egg, who knew it would turn into such a huge thing and become a part of my life! A few months later, The Dark Knight stole its thunder and became the talk of the town with Heath Ledger's performance and possibly winning Oscars so the thought about the MCU was very far from my mind in 2008.", "As a bright-eyed 11 year-old when it came out, I absolutely loved it.", "i remember thinking after that summer that Iron Man was the best comic book movie ever made and The Dark Knight was the best graphic novel movie ever made.", "Very different feel from today\u2019s MCU. It was a little more \u201cgrown up,\u201d if you will, and the serious parts were more traditional Hollywood action serious.\n\nBut yes it definitely felt like it led into something bigger and building a movie universe.\n\nVery ambitious and bold since at that point oftentimes actors didn\u2019t play the same character too many times, let alone an entire group of actors, although Harry Potter made it possible, so there was a lot of hope that this could work too.", "I've been an Iron Man fan for a while, so it was awesome to see him done justice. Hearing Favreau insert [the old 1960s cartoon theme tune](https://youtu.be/LjTIVaSnRR0?feature=shared) a few places [here](https://youtu.be/OEnUcgIzzM0?si=kd1lRqTHXZ1Q-B6U) and [there](https://youtu.be/_873UeiwnVA?si=F_ZbJOBn9CDVFWUS) told me that we were in good hands; a fan was directing. I had already been hyped by the trailer (of course, [most people were](https://youtu.be/YBM3j7x4Lcw?si=RSts6UzXtZ5DETAn)), but I was staying cautious in my optimism. But the movie was awesome. It had everything; slapstick with the tests and DUM-E, suspense with Pepper and Stane, action, sexytimes, explosions and a sarcastic virtual butler.", "I LOVED it! I was a (not diehard) comic book fan and had mixed reactions to most previous superhero movies. For instance it really bothered me that the Spider-Man movies kept killing off his best villains. \nIron Man and Incredible Hulk which both came out in 2008 just felt like they took the story more seriously and didn\u2019t try to shy away from how comics *work*.", "The Mark II suit-up scene was epic. Then the Gulmira scene was awesome. Just seeing him pick them apart.", "I thought it was very well done, and it being so comic book accurate really made it work.  Downey was Tony Stark.", "It was a really good, above average comic book movie. The after credits scene was exciting for its sheer potential, but it felt like such a distant thing. It was totally overshadowed by The Dark Knight that year, which felt like a seismic moment in cinema at the time.", "Character and tone was what set this one apart at the time. It was really refreshing and light on its feet compared to most of the superhero movies that came before. A lot of that had to do with Robert Downey Jr.'s performance, but it was also one of the first times where it felt like they didn't have to compromise too much in depicting the hero's powers (in this case the suit).", "It was amazing and is still one of my favourite movies. Iron Man has always been one of my favourite superheroes so I was super excited that he finally got a movie.", "For my friends and I it wasn\u2019t just a really good superhero movie, it was fucking awesome. Even better than Batman Begins, which was stellar.", "Not a comic reader but I enjoyed the movie a lot. It's still top 5 MCU movies. Also after the credit scene my friends went nuts with the reveal meanwhile me and another person was like ok what is shield?", "I was still pretty young - I was in 6th grade in 2008, so I was like 11 or 12 years old. I vividly remember seeing it in theaters with my dad, and we both absolutely loved it. I was already a massive Spider-Man fan, having grown up on the Raimi movies and reruns of the 90s cartoon. \n\nWasn't a comic reader yet because there were no shops anywhere near where I grew up, so I didn't know much about any character who wasn't an A-lister at the time (I.e. All of the avengers haha). I had obviously seen many of them but knew pretty much nothing.\n\nWe also had no clue about the MCU or anything relating to this being a shared universe prior, and for a while after too. I feel like \"insider news\" on this stuff wasn't as readily available online so I just didn't see any sort of discussion. As far as we knew, it was the same as Spider Man or Fantastic Four - a standalone thing. We didn't even see the post credit scene cause we didn't know to stay \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Well for me I was a child, like 10-11 yrs old. I also didn't have regular access to the Internet/WiFi to know about the post credit scene, because I don't remember having a reaction to the Nick Fury scene. So I'm guessing my family walked out before I could see it. But of course the movie itself was amazing. I only knew about IM through games and cartoons, so I was hyped to see something new. \n\nI'm actually not even sure when I learned it would be a bigger universe tbh.", "The internet was so different then. I was still in highschool when Iron Man was announced. Back then alot of my comic book movie news came from reading Wizard mag and rumors on message boards. There were rumblings of Nick Fury and SHIELD but man watching Iron Man for the first time was special. You could tell the movie was sowing seeds and not in an easter egg way. Then when that post credit hit it was like WHOA SAM FUCKING JACKSON as Nick Fury. Theyre doing it!", "For me I went to the movie thinking it would be a one off dumb action flick. I was an iron man back in the day. I collected the comics but i was not expecting much from the movie given that at the time iron man was a b to c type character. After the movie I was blown away. I did not even fathom how much i would enjoy this movie. \n\nI still liked the dark knight movie more however iron man made so many freaking awesome turns. The first was Phil saying the name of agency to Pepper, she starts to say the full name, then phil cuts her off and said just call us shield. I had a mind blown. \n\nThen the biggest and freaking awesome change for me was Tony telling everyone he is iron man. Usually in superhero costume movies like batman, batman does everything he can to hid his identity even though half the characters know by the end so having Tony blurt it out was sooooo awesome.", "I was 12 when it came out and it was the coolest movie I had ever seen I was already a comicbook nerd but it really blew my mind at the time", "It was an insane experience. All the kids at my school were talking about it, we would compare him to Spider-Man, Batman etc. I also had all the toys", "I was 13 when it came out, saw it with my family. All 4 of us enjoyed it and were excited that it was getting a sequel.", "I am a comic book fan, my wife is not. I talked her into seeing it. She thought it was okay, a cheesy superhero movie, and she appreciated the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow. \n\nI thought it was entertaining, better than expected.   \n  \nIt was brilliant that out of all the possible B-list heroes, Marvel started things out with Iron Man -- a technology-based superhero, which seemed like it required the least amount of suspension-of-disbelief in 2008, when all kinds of tech had really matured, from iPhones to broadband. And Samuel J Jackson was actually cast as Nick Fury, and that Adi Granov's design was appropriated (and later properly recognized). \n\nWas totally convinced Thor would flop, and that Avengers would never gel properly. I gave up trying to second-guess after GotG -- a Z-list comic book title -- was a hit.", "It came at a perfect time. CBMs were starting to become a new Hollywood norm over the previous decade plus, but obviously none of the Marvel projects were tied in together. So they felt more like the comics where there was a sporadic nature to the storytelling. \n\nI think audiences were ready for more, though. Coming off the X-Men and Raimi trilogies, crossovers were more in demand. Iron Man was a weird litmus test on paper because he wasn\u2019t an A-list level hero. He was liked, but took a backseat to the other marvel characters who have had multiple eras of live action projects. The premise of the movie was interesting and RDJ had just gotten back in some people\u2019s good graces with a few notable performances. People wanted it to be good.\n\nThe moment that I knew something special was in the works was the shot of Iron Man with the explosives in the background. The CGI on the suit to this day is flawless. The post credit scene  was the first time we marvel fans felt real hype for crossover potential. \n\nNo one could have imagined it\u2019d turn into arguably the greatest movie franchise of all time (by far) but the formula was there. The heart, the comedy, the action. The production process was really organic. Very little corporate interference and a ton of improv. You can feel that on screen. It\u2019s still my favorite MCU movie.", "Was really cool I was like 9 or 10 and the movies still ingrained in my brain all these years", "Saw it opening night and loved it.  Waiting in line, the staff of the theater were very excited for us to see it and went along the line imploring us to stay for the post-credit sequence (Usually theaters don't want you to that because they they have no time to clean.)", "It felt like another super hero movie to me but in an upper tier like Spider Man 2.  You must realize, this was the same summer as The Dark Knight and once that was released, I forgot about Iron Man.  I didn't realize how big the MCU would get once I saw The Avengers, my mind was blown and I was 100% in.", "Instantly fell in love with rdj and iron man. Never knew that hero from marvel.\n\nHad a craving for cheeseburger from Burger King as I came out of the theater to my dad car and throughout the week", "I'm of the age where X-men were my first and deepest exposure to Marvel. They were all the rage in the 90s and were what got me interested into Marvel. Spiderman was cool and had a few movies. The Hulk was awesome but wasn't overly exposed.\n\nGoing into Iron Man, I was open. I liked RDJ and thought he was great casting. To be fair, I didn't know much beyond the surface about Iron Man, because he was never popular in culture. The movie was great. It dealt vaguely with terrorism and the military industrial complex during a time of endless war.\n\nWhen he said \"I am Iron Man\" at the end, the theater erupted. You could tell this was something different. A better comic book movie than we had seen for many years. The after-credits was amazing. I was all in.", "I watched it because I remember watching the 90s cartoon. My friend was an comic book reader that knew the basics of Earth 616 and the groups and what not.\n\nIt was awesome seeing the special effects and see a man fly. I thought we hit the limit cgi could create with Spiderman but seeing Iron Man was just orgasmic. Especially the HUD. Just freaking phenomenal.\n\nOh and had no idea who SHIELD, Avengers, or Nick Fury were. Besides the Punisher game.", "I was not a huge Marvel fan but I knew Iron Man well and always thought he was an interesting character. I was also not super hyped because super hero movies had mostly been pretty bad for a while - I love Batman and enjoyed Batman Begins, but the Dark Knight hadn\u2019t come out yet. I\u2019m also a big movie guy, and fan of Favreau, so I was curious and cautiously optimistic, but mostly expected another Daredevil or Fantastic Four. \n\nI really liked the first two acts, all of the setup, Downey and his irreverence, and the CGI was great for the time. But the third act felt very rushed, like they had just remembered they needed a big villain and kinda decided at the last minute to put Bridges in that suit and have a big fight.  It left me feeling a bit bored and unfulfilled. What I did enjoy was his big reveal and bucking of a secret identity at the end, and the Avengers tease. Both felt original and fresh and kept me interested. \n\nI hated the Incredible Hulk and enjoyed Thor and Captain America, but thought they felt like watered down imitations of better movies, especially after Sark Knight. It was the Avengers that really hooked me and got me into everything. (I\u2019ve since come  to appreciate the first Cap a bit more. Fun movie.)\n\nSide note - I watched Iron Man recently and was so surprised to see how much it aged! 2007/2008 styles and humor, etc. but it was a fun rewatch.", "I think it's more than \"I saw it, and it was good.\"\n\nFrom 1998-2005, comic book movies were really picking up steam. They weren't perfect, but we were still excited for the future. X2, Batman Begins, Sin City, V for Vendetta, Spider-Man 2, Hellboy, Blade 2. All great. 2006-2007 and Spider-Man 3, Ghost Rider, Superman Returns, FF 2, and X-Men 3 kinda divided fans. I felt like it left us in a bit of a dull time except for 300. \n\nIron Man gets announced to have RDJ, and people are like \"well that's just good casting.\" We see our first picture of him with the beard and thinking it could work. But you gotta remember how tight 2008 was. You had Iron Man, Hulk, Hellboy 2, and motherfucking The Dark Knight all coming out in the span of a few months. People were talking about how Incredible Hulk could possibly have Iron Man, but one is Paramount, and one is Universal, so it seemed impossible. The trailers, clips, and pics made it seem like yeah, they're trying to do a good job. They want to take it seriously and do it right, not some tongue-in-cheek toy commercial.\n\nIt comes out, and people are like, \"STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!\" So you get a pretty good movie that has action and laughs. It was well written and directed. It made a lot of people into Iron Man fans. It felt like comic book movies were totally back now. We had a slump, but we're coming back. The after-credits though blows our minds, and now we have all these ideas of what IS coming. There's excitement again. People talked about Iron Man quite a bit until TDK came out. A lot of people compare MCU films today, but back then, you compared Iron Man to say Daredevil or Punisher. It really held the title for best Marvel film until the MCU started becoming an actual thing.\n\nI never really thought while sitting through Iron Man that one day I was going to see the Avengers try to stop Thanos, Spider-Man fight Captain America, comic accurate Galactus, or even Wolverine rip someone up with his claws. Tell me that 20 years ago, and I'd have chuckled.", "i mean hero movies before iron man 1 were like. nolans batman which was good the 3rd spiderman movie which was bad the 3rd xmen movie which was terrible fantastic 4 which was trash and that one pretty bad superman movie daredevil which was bad. nobody really thought it would become this big cause tbh nobody really cared about marvel pre mcu. most people liked DC far more. nolans 2nd bad man movie came out like either a month or two before or after and it was pretty much all anyone talked about outside of clowning on iron mans theme song by going \" i am iron man i jack off with my right hand\"", "Me then: They should make more movies like this!\u00a0\n\nMe now: Not that many more.\u00a0", "I was surprised it was as good as it was. I was excited but I didn't expect it to actually be such a strong film. Superhero movies were definitely not a guaranteed money maker.", "We knew that Marvel movies were not that great prior to Ironman.  We had hope that this would turn it around.  X-Men and Spider-Man franchises were thriving after having their rights sold to Sony and Fox.  Fantastic Four also was a success.  So we were hopeful that Ironman would finally turn it around and do it right.\n\nI loved Elf, and I also loved Swingers, so I had somewhat a trust for Jon Favreau, but he hadn't done anything like this before.\n\nAs for the casting of RDJ.  He was an excellent actor.  We knew his struggles with addiction.  So at the time, we felt like this would be a good casting choice to portray Tony Stark, with his struggles with alcoholism in the comics.  I felt confident that this was the right casting choice.\n\nAs I watched and enjoyed the movie in the theater, I loved every minute of it.  It was definitely better than previous Marvel produced films.  (not owned by Fox or Sony)\n\nThen we saw the post credits scene.  We were cautiously optimistic that we would eventually get to see an Avengers film.  A team up movie with interconnected movies had never been done before.  We were excited for what the future would hold.  Anticipation for the next movies grew, and we thought we would be blessed just to get to Avengers in 2012.\n\nNever could we have imagined it would have grown into what it is today.  We weren't so blessed with superhero movies that we grew up reading in the comics, as much as we are today.", "I was 15 saw with my mom and brother at the movies it was fun and awesome.When sam Jackson appeared as nick fury in the  end and talk about the avengers I was sock and excited \ud83d\ude0a \ud83e\udd17 \ud83d\ude03", "No expectations cuz superhero movies generally werent that good to that point and RDJ was known as \"that drug addict actor\" or \"the guy who nailed it playing Charlie Chaplin\"\n\nI was blown away and RDJ killed it.", "It was awesome. I saw it 3 days in a row with friends", "Longtime Comic reader and X-Men fan; went in thinking 'Who gives a shit about Iron Man?!' and walked out thinking 'Well that was pretty damn good.'", "\u201c\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\uddb8\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u201d", "Walked in very apprehensive. The trailer looked great but it was more likely a Cronenberg - body horror flick than what we got. \n\nI was happily surprised.", "I'm not a very avid comic reader but I absorbed all other media from comics, namely the shows and games. I was estatic as hell to see Iron Man when it first came out. I followed the movie's production closely, distinctly recalling it was the only year I was **EXCITED** for the superbowl because I knew the first full Iron Man trailer would play for it and I was glued to the screen when it came on. I saw it opening weekend and I was blown away by how fucking good it was.\n\nRDJ was a perfect Tony Stark while Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow brought Obadiah Stane and Pepper Pots to life. I was kinda 'eh' on Terrence Howard's Rhodey, but it was alright. I was stupidly giddy at Coulson hinting at SHIELD and the terrorists in the first half of the movie being The Ten Rings meaning more was to come. And the Iron Man suit was PERFECT. To this day no superhero suit looks as perfect of a live action adaptation than the Mark 3 Armor. The character drama and interactions felt so realistic yet still comic book like while the humor was spot on. Aside from Howard, pretty much everything about IM1 was a perfect first forray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe even on a first viewing. That said this was 17 years ago so I honestly don't remember the audience experience.\n\nSadly I knew NOTHING about the post-credit scene and only heard about it after seeing the movie. Thankfully somebody put it online and seeing it made me excited as all fucking hell since by then Hulk would be out soon while Thor and Captain America were already in production which meant it was indeed happening.\n\nSeeing MCU films opening weekend became a trend for me and I saw every single one from then until I skipped on Eternals. I even recall irritating the hell out of my brother and his then-GF because I *refused* to leave the theater until I saw the end credits teaser of Iron Man 2 (seeing Mjolnir for the first time as the teaser for Thor). It was a hell of a ride and I don't regret a bit of it.", "at that point in time people were watching superhero movies for the set pieces since vfx has advanced enough to make the powers on display look authentic, as opposed to the shitty camera effects of the past decades. stories were nothing to write home about. x-men films were tedious going point A to B, with the occasional \"hey this guy on screen is a mutant in the comics\" pointing. only remembered spider-man swinging across new york most of the time, partly due to chad kroeger's music video, not much else\n\nthought to myself watching iron man, it's going to be big, do a sequel or two, and fade out of mind until the next \"it\" thing, as is standard at the time. didn't expect it to spawn the interconnected universe we see today though, because it was simply unheard of\n\ncasting-wise, serviceable. wasn't old (nor interested) enough to follow RDJ's career in the 90s, didn't even know the guy's struggles until years later", "I thought it was the best superhero movie I'd ever seen. And then Dark Knight came out like 2 months later and I liked that even more. Good year for comic book movies!", "The vibe was cool. The down-to-earth feel of Tony constructing the suit was very well done. The interplay between Tony and Pepper was intriguing without fully going romance. \n\nThe twist with Obi being the main antagonist was fun with the reveal being quite late.", "I remember people liked it but it didn't really stick with people at the time just on its own. It was totally overshadowed by the Dark Knight. HL's performance and his actually dying gave that movie sort of an untouchable mythic quality. And look, my quibbles with Nolan's tone aside, it's a really good fucking movie. But apart from the Joker himself, the movies aren't all that much fun. \n\nI remember being in my regular bar talking about it versus Batman and telling people how I liked it more because it was fun, and unsurprisingly finding myself in the minority. Nobody was really thinking about the serialization of film at the time, the Nick Fury tease mostly struck us a kind of a fun hat-tip.\n\nBut we did talk about it. Man, wouldn't that be cool if they could pull that off. It would be ludicrous to even try, the movies couldn't even seem to get the Hulk right.\n\nI did take an Iron Man DVD over to a friend's place at one point and have them watch it with me because I wanted to tell somebody that all I really wanted was a Doctor Strange movie that was worth a damn, and if they manage to pull off the avengers that was how I could get it. It's a tough sell for a movie, it's a niche character. But if they could build the world and sell the world, suddenly everything is on the table. And that would be wild.", "The first thing we thought was 'They got Robert Downy Jr?? Seriously?? That drug addict, alcoholic, felon? We didn't have much high hopes for it. Then we saw it, and. It. Blew. Us. Away. That ending were he says 'I am Iron-Man' Inspired! We were raving by the time the movie ended, and are friends who didn't go opening night, we told them it was Must See. When they didn't believe us, we told them they wouldn't believe until they saw it. Then, after they did, they were raving as well. Very few people thought it'd be worth seeing.", "I thought it was meh. Ive since succumbed to Marvel /Suoerhero dominance.of Hollywood but I found it a paint by number super hero/comic book origin story. It had (has) some cool moments, but I still feel the same way mostly.", "I was in awe. Saw it 4 more times. I remember making a special effort to record the moment when he flies down and takes out that terrorist org and saves the father and son just so I could watch that clip over and over again", "I was with a couple guys I was kinda friends with (one of whom I had a huge crush on) and didn\u2019t want to inconvenience them, so we didn\u2019t stay through the end credits even though something told me we should. \n\nWill never make that mistake again. Both the crush on an unobtainable boy and not staying till the very end.", "it was fun. Iron Man was a B-tier hero at the time, but he was probably my favorite Avenger besides Vision. \n\ni really liked how they worked SHIELD into the story and that Tony just came out at the end and announced he was Iron Man, since i always found the cover story very silly in the comics.\n\nit didn't seem as impressive as the time though as what Nolan was doing with Batman, and i really get fired up about the idea of Avengers until after seeing Hulk and Thor also succeed.", "I had to beg my friend to convince his mom to take us, he tried to convince me to see Horton hears a who, but I pushed so hard for Iron Man. It was a huge moment for me personally as I had owned a few iron man toys cause I loved comic shops. Before that movie there wasn\u2019t really one where I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the screen I think I saw it like 2 more times", "I remember most the video of Iron flying that they showed in the previous Comicon. I remember being really hyped cause we knew they were gonna Cap and Thor next and they would all meet in Avengers (an unprecedented thing in movies back then). Watching Ironman in theaters was really fun and the post credits scene was mind blowing.", "I was happy to see one of my first favourite superheroes on screen.  I felt like the whole superhero genre just gained some more legitimacy.  And it's still a great, fun, and funny movie.", "I enjoyed it!!! Of course I was just a kid, but I thought it was the coolest movie ever!", "The story was great but the action was underwhelming.   \nThe suit-up was the best thing about it.", "This is it. It was exciting but I had no idea that it was leading somewhere until the dots started linking together.", "Most comic book movies crashed and burned by the third installment so I had low hopes that we would even get an actual Avengers movie. I figured we\u2019d get two good movies and then by the time they introduce the third Avenger, the story would already be too convoluted for the average audience. Whatever your opinion of Joss Whedon is these days, he managed to do the impossible at the time, and watching that first trailer drop will always be some of the most hype moments for Marvel fans my age.", "100% this. Nobody knew that it was going to be the start of something epic.", "Yeah, my thoughts exactly. We already had other super hero movies and nothing ever lead to anything huge, they were just cool movies, which is what I took from Iron Man. Now when Avengers came out, that was real special.", "Exactly my wife and I. She considers the first Iron Man movie to be the best MCU movie in terms of tone and balancing humor with action with drama. At this point, she's also pretty done with superhero movies in general.", "I remember thinking the post credits was cool but never thinking it was actually going to lead to anything big.", "As a high school kid I thought it was mind-blowing, especially the first full suiting up sequence.", "Yep. It was a good movie with a fun nod to fans at the end about the \"avenger initiative\". Then Dark Knight came out later that summer, and that was mind-blowing.", "Right? Christopher Nolan really flipped a semi truck and blew up a building disguised as a hospital in TDK.\n\nThat movie was truly groundbreaking.\n\nIron Man showed that marvel heroes other than Spider-Man and Xmen could be a resounding success. That\u2019s worth a mention\u00a0", "Not the extent, but Incredible Hulk was just a few months later. If you paid attention, you knew this was coming.", "For real, I don't know where all these people are getting that it wasn't a big deal, I remember it being huge and everyone loved it, it was universally celebrated at least from my memory", "That\u2019s awesome!", "The ripple effect is insane when you look back at it!", "I think that's part of what made Iron Man stand out in its own way. The Dark Knight is still phenomenal and was a mature take on a superhero movie, but Iron Man was a breath of fresh air. It was fun, witty, and had a certain lightness to it that felt different from what we were used to.", "Good point. Batman Begins was a success, Superman Returns was not, and we were in an era where only Batman movies could be good comic movies. Plus the Avengers were seen as leftovers.", "Yep 12-14 y/o kid were the target audience and that paid up because once we hit 19 avenger came out and we rode up until endgame", "Similar stunts have been done plenty of times before TDK lol what was groundbreaking was Ledger\u2019s performance and the movie\u2019s use of IMAX.\n\nIron Man was a great, well-done movie, but what was groundbreaking is how it started the MCU, which popularized shared universes.", "This was 2008, I was convinced it would suck. I could not believe they nailed it. The only good superhero movies back then were X-men mostly. Everything else tended to be very very bad.", "Strangely enough, I didn\u2019t see another MCU movie in the theater until Doctor Strange. Then I slowly went back and got caught up on everything. Ironically, my son lost all interest in the MCU(he got into anime as a teenager) while I developed an obsession with it.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 He will still go with me on opening night if we\u2019re in the same place, and he only teases me about it a little bit.\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s hard to fathom for the younger fans but at the time, X-Men and Spiderman was Marvel. Everything else is considered C-listers.", "Wow, thanks for poo pooing my praise of some genuinely cool special effects.\u00a0\n\nMy point was that Iron Man did nothing like that. TDK was ambitious in almost every facet of the movie.\u00a0", "That sounded more harsh than I intended lol I know all this is subjective. \n\nI\u2019m just saying in my opinion that the special effects weren\u2019t what made these movies groundbreaking."], "category": "hot", "linkTitle": "Too Many Requests"}

Not great.\n\nPhase 2: thor the dark world was a big dud and people had mixed feelings on age of ultron and iron man 3. \n\nLet\u2019s be generous here and say again 4/6 or against 66% was good. \n\nThis has a string of 2/4 depending on your opinion of AOU, definitely not universal though.\n\nPhase 3: this is probably the best example of a string of good movies but doctor strange had some mixed feelings and both ant man and the wasp and captain marvel were duds.\n\nLet\u2019s say 8/11 or 72% of these are good (one could argue 9/11 but at that point I\u2019d say to keep it fair to both sides we remove the Spider-Man movies since those were made by Sony. This leaves it as fair as possible)\n\nHere there\u2019s a string of 5 universally praised movies, an outlier and imo the reason why people think the mcu in the infinity saga was so good, but this wasn\u2019t the regular. \n\nIf we look past that:\n\nPhase 4: this phase has 2 duds with love and thunder and eternals and 2 movies with mixed reception, black widow and doctor strange MoM.\n\nSo let\u2019s call it 4/7 again 57% we\u2019re good. Close to phases 1-2 (under 10% difference) but a slight decline.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even say phase 4 has a string of 2 good movies, a new low in consistency but very close to consistent in overall quality. \n\nPhase 5: Quantumania and The Marvels were definite duds and brave new world got mixed reception. \n\nRounding up just like I did with phases 1 and 2 there\u2019s 4/6 universally loved movies (early reports like this suggest thunderbolts* is amazing so I\u2019m saying it\u2019s good for now)\n\nConsidering brave new world was overall liked with several criticisms I\u2019d say there was a string of 3 good movies, not universally loved, but good. \n\n\nSUMMARY: Overall the argument can be made that the multiverse saga is marginally worse but a 9% difference of the general consensus seems insignificant imo. \n\nThe consistency is worse, I\u2019ll give you that but we\u2019re also getting less bad movies in a row unlike earlier phases. Rather than getting 2 good movies and 2 bad ones in that order were now getting 1 good, 1 bad, 1 good, 1 bad. \n\nAnd I personally don\u2019t really see how that matters considering the overall quality is roughly the same.\n\nIt may be the big drop from a jump up to 72% good by the general consensus to 57% a 15% drop. That\u2019s pretty big. But when we take a step back and look at the mcu as a whole it\u2019s not like it took a major nosedive and crashed and burned. \n\nThey made 1 more bad movie than usual in phase 4 and phase 3 is an outlier that really should be split in 2, and there\u2019s the Spider-Man movies which are questionable as to whether they should count or not. \n\nNot a perfect science by any means but I think according to most people\u2019s opinions they truly think the mcu is overall REALLY consistent from the beginning to now, despite them screaming at the top of their lungs otherwise. \n\nNOTE: this is NOT my opinion, I have some wild mcu takes (I love the dark world and hate ragnarok for example) this is my understanding of the general consensus.\n\nIt\u2019s also NOT counting shows which I think would help phases 4 and 5 significantly. \n\nIf you disagree with this or anything I said, cool tell me why, let\u2019s talk about it", "Can we count show?", "When was it ever \"on track\"?\n\nThe Internet tends to mythologize the first three phases. \n\nPhase 1 had Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, and though I loved it, many are critical of The First Avenger.\n\nPhase 2 had The Dark World and Iron Man 3 (similar case as TFA for IM3).\n\nPhase 3, though easily the strongest in the franchise, still had relative misses like Ant Man 2, Captain Marvel, and Black Panther (loved it, really slow, and sadly overhyped, respectively).\n\nMy point is that there never put out all bangers in a phase.

And what are some changes you would\u2019ve changed in it?\n\nMe personally I\u2019ll have to say that I was still young so I was not all familiar with the comics yet, but I will say that I did really like how Ultron was in the film even if there\u2019s a lot of problems with how he\u2019s portrayed in the mcu compared to his comics self and other media (especially cause not many liked his design but I thought it worked well), and I feel like when it comes to the \u201cTony creating ultron vs Hank pym creating ultron\u201d debate, I think the mcu did it well with the Tony creating ultron, even though this already existed before in the next avengers animated film prior to the mcu, jumping forward years later when I began to read more comics, I can agree that Hank should be the creator of ultron (also I did watched the emh show before reading comics too, but then again, I was young, I wasn\u2019t all that familiar with the comics but I did still like it regardless and Ultron in emh is very much so his best adaptation, and I agree years later today!), but in the mcu, Tony being his creator I think works well for what it is.\n\nAnd it sucks how this would be the last we\u2019ll see the original 6 avengers together because after that they aren\u2019t together again until endgame, but I still really liked their dynamic in the film either way, not sure what to feel about the whole Bruce x Natasha thing the film tried setting up but I think it\u2019s\u2026fine, but still really like everyone getting to interact with each other without having it be a mission and especially the party scene (well, before Ultron interrupted).\n\nI also feel like this movie made me like the mcu a whole lot more, I did see iron man 3, gotg vol 1, and the winter soldier prior to it but I guess it didn\u2019t like really peaked my liking to the series yet until age of ultron.\n\nAnd I still find it pretty good 10 years later, it holds a special place in my heart cause it\u2019s where I really began to like the mcu a lot and still find it to be a good film, probably not top 10 best mcu films ever but still good regardless\n\nBut anyways yeah, that\u2019s how I feel about the film (and my story about it too), did it increase your interest in the mcu same as me? What was your experience with it? Well if you made it all the way here i appreciate you for listening to my ted talk!", "author": "ThatVenomFan", "upvotes": 1840, "postID": "1kc2b09", "postImage": "https://i.redd.it/btm2ij8g94ye1.jpeg", "postUrl": "/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kc2b09/avengers_age_of_ultron_came_out_10_years_ago_today/", "comments": ["![gif](giphy|VdDOvkaDobhgk|downsized)", "Sad to think this was the last time the avengers were all together", "At the time I wasn't that big a fan of it as so many new characters got introduced, and it all felt a bit rushed and had too much stuff going on.\n\nThe \"fake out\" of Ultron's character too, where in the trailers he was all menacing and dark and nasty, but then in his in-movie conversations he's making jokes and *forgetting words*?!

She catches Sam as he\u2019s falling from like 30 feet up with the shoulder she got shot in twelve hours earlier without complaint, and that\u2019s FAR from the only thing like that she does, just the most blatant.", "If I remember correctly, in the comics she was born in 1928, and the red room version of super serum extended her life just like Captain America.", "Sure, because spies never lie and always blab about all of their personal info. You can still baby trap someone, you just lie about being pregnant. Plus, who says the Red Room isn't harvesting eggs to freeze while doing the surgeries?", "I honestly just consider that to be canon, just not explicitly stated. There\u2019s no other explanation for the kind of shit Natasha can do without permanent injury.", "Action movie heroes routinely perform literally impossible feats of athleticism, but Black Widow seems like the only character who\u2019s ever called out on it.", "Just knowing by what the USSR was doing to competitive athletes in the 1980s, it's tough to believe they wouldn't give performance chemicals to elite secret agents.\u00a0", "[removed]", "If we use the equivalent normal human from the real world, I don't see how Sam, Clint or Natasha can do what they do seeing as none of them are enhanced. You just don't have the same level of recovery/protection from injuries and ability to maintain strength, agility and endurance that enhanced people have. You're just not going to be able to keep up in the long run.\n\nPut any of them in these same scenarios and it's unrealistic.\n\nPersonally, I account for this by thinking this is the MCU, where alien races like the Celestials and Kree have messed with the DNA of humanity over thousands of years. I think because of this there are just more humans in the MCU that have physical and mental abilities that go beyond the bounds of what we consider to be normal humanity.", "I still believe they all got a temu super soldier serum. Every other non enhanced character is less able than them.", "The one that always gets me is the first Avengers movie where Cap launches her and she grabs a passing Chitauri and doesn't get her arm ripped clean off", "Yeah, it was a combo infinity formula + super soldier serum.", "That's how it is in some versions of the comic character, anyway.  Even if they don't have her being pre-WWII, the entire set-up with the Red Room would work just as well, if not better, to say they use a discount / half as effective version of the serum.", "Comparing the widows to other characters that aren\u2019t confirmed enhanced, they\u2019re still above and beyond (if you ignore the fact that irl glass is actually quite hard to break with blunt force). Clint never does anything to that degree of insanity, Tony and Rhodey have armor, Sam doesn\u2019t do anything insane outside of the suit. Natasha grabs a Chitauri speeder doing 50 with one arm and hangs on. She falls four stories bouncing off things and gets to her feet to talk with a widow who fell four stories straight down and is still completely capable of conversation and moving her arms. She\u2019s notably more durable than a standard human. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s calling her out, it\u2019s just interpreting what we\u2019re given.", "I criticize Hawkeye frequently. He\u2019s not super anything yet has perceived superhuman accuracy?", "Seriously, the Crash from the First Iron Man Suit should have killed Tony or at the very least turn him into the Civil War Version of Rhodey but nobody calls him out on it and say he's Superhuman, it's always the Widows characters.", "Nah, Sam gets called out on it a lot now that he's Captain America. People seem to think the only way to throw that damn Frisbee is with super strength.", "Yeah, every single other non-enhanced Avenger routinely does some seriously superhuman stuff. That includes Sam, and especially Hawkeye. Hawkeye seems way more superhuman than Black Widow.", "The elite secret agents who they train in secret from childhood, brainwash, and later mind control, in particular. They\u2019re not people to them, they\u2019re assets; no need to worry about silly things like medical ethics.", "Is this from the thunderbolts?", "Oh, Sam and Clint should also be fucked, but in terms of durability, they\u2019re not quite at the same level as the widows are in terms of just absolutely tanking shit.", "If we use a normal human from our world, John Wick is a superhero.", "They definitely got SOMETHING, and Natasha from the comics had a derivative of the SSS as well, so.", "In a world where Shang-Chi exists, I find this whole debate hilarious.", "That\u2019s the other major one, but at least she hadn\u2019t been SHOT in that shoulder recently.", "Clint has an entire D+ series showing the physical toll on his body.  In the BW movie, we see Nat fall _exactly_ the same way as another Black Widow, who dies while she survives without any issue.\n\nThey should have just made it canon that the Red Room gave the Widows a discount / less effective serum, the same way as (some) comic runs.", "He doesn't have superhuman accuracy. He has seemingly superhuman accuracy. He doesn't have a gene that makes him more likely to hit a target, he's just a ridiculously good shot because he spent the time firing a lot of arrows in a lot of conditions over and over until it became instinct.", "That cus that would make iron man suits impossible so they ignore it.", "Hawkeye threw it, Nat threw it, but the moment Sam picks it up he's too black to throw a frisbee or something.", "And with Red Guardian being around, we _know_ the Soviets had their own serum.", "From the porn version", "Yes", "Well, they obviously choose some exceptional candidates for that Red Room, they likely have some sort of system for identifying them. As I said, humans in the MCU aren't like us, they are genetically different as a whole. \n\nIn real life if you get hit with a huge dose of gamma rays you die, you don't turn into a giant green monster. There are no space gods that come down to visit and exchange genetic material with humans. People aren't building miniature fusion reactors in a cave with scraps in real life or creating time travel machines.\n\nThe super heroes who are \"unenhanced\" doing things that are way out of the ordinary for a normal human in real life are the least far fetched part of the MCU.", "That other widow falls straight down and survives (though she is injured) and is made to kill herself. Nat bounces off a bunch of ducting on her way down.", "I don\u2019t know where I saw it/read it but the theory was that since the widows are \u201cchosen\u201d they can choose kids that show signs of more durability, plus the training would make some of the widows stronger than your average human. Still doesn\u2019t fully justify all that Nat and Yelena can withstand but I find that information could be part of what makes them stronger", "I mean, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt in that those times Clintband Nat threw it to Steve, but FatWS explicitly shows Walker training with the damn thing and he never gets flak for it. Meanwhile, Sam, also shown to train with it as well as already having ridiculous reflexes and capable of rapid calculations in order to fly in nothing but a jumpsuit and jetpack, isn't allowed to calculate the necessary angles to throw the shield.", "Yeah, that's the thing that gets me. They have access to that, there's no way they're not giving it at some level.\n\nThe widows are supposed to both be very attractive but also mostly blend in, so I'm assuming they got some sort of... People keep saying watered down, but I actually think it would be reformulated into being more about agility and speed, and keeping durability, but lowering strength a little. This makes it less obvious, both in what they can do and just less large muscles. (I mean, we've seen Peggy Carter on the serum, she is big. Not absurdly big but you can tell she is strong.)", "If it *was* everybody I\u2019d go \u201coh so it\u2019s just MCU stuff then,\u201d but it\u2019s NOT everybody. Clint goes through a window in Avengers and just groans and doesn\u2019t get up. I can\u2019t recall Sam ever doing anything physically impressive that the suit isn\u2019t taking the brunt of (though it\u2019s admittedly been a while since I\u2019ve seen TFATWS and I only saw BNW once). Natasha gets her *shit rocked* even by in universe standards and the only time that has any sort of lasting effect is when she gets shot through the shoulder, and the \u201clasting effect\u201d from that only lasts for a few hours. Clint is an absolutely elite fighter and he doesn\u2019t handle the hits anywhere nearly as well as she does; he\u2019s admittedly 10-15 years older than Natasha, but he\u2019s the closest we\u2019ve got. Like, most of the unenhanced are at around standard human action hero levels. I wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow at Jason Bourne or James Bond walking off the kinds of things Clint walks off. But I just think Natasha is a slight step above that.\n\nAnd they *could* say she\u2019s unenhanced and I\u2019d go \u201coh okay\u201d and move on, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve specifically addressed that, and Natasha in the comics has low grade enhancements, so I don\u2019t think interpreting the events of the movies as Widows having low grade enhancements is beyond the pale.", "Or they could just lift lots of weights and exercise. Problem solved.", "\"Watered down\" works for the implication, I think.  But yeah, I don't know why they shied away from it.  It would make 1000% more sense with everything Nat (and now Yelena) have survived.", "You're really kind of jaded by having watched a lot of action movies, because human action hero levels of ability is already way beyond what any normal human can do. \n\nGetting thrown through a glass window would kill most people.\n\nSam flies a jetpack that can do maneuvers that most planes or drones cannot do. One could argue that the suits he wears protects him from the g-forces involved, but he literally is in street clothes in the Winter Soldier flying that thing around.\n\nEven if the Black Widow is above that, it's not particularly hard to believe given the context we're dealing with here.", "Like I said. If they address it and say she\u2019s explicitly not enhanced, I\u2019ll go \u201coh okay.\u201d It\u2019s not *hard* to believe she couldn\u2019t possibly be enhanced, but given that she\u2019s an elite spy from a country that had a partially successful super soldier program and no compunction about doing fucked up shit to the children in th Black Widow program, I interpret her going somewhat above and beyond even the general standard of being a badass in a movie as evidence she\u2019s enhanced. It doesn\u2019t mean she absolutely has to be, but it\u2019s how I choose to interpret what we\u2019re given, and that *also* shouldn\u2019t be hard to believe. Both are plausible. But it\u2019s a world where super soldiers are a dime a dozen at this point, so \u201cshe\u2019s probably a little juiced\u201d doesn\u2019t seem like it should be controversial."], "category": "hot", "linkTitle": "Too Many Requests"}

(Full disclosure, to maintain my sanity I did use chatgpt initially to run the bulk of the searches. I used the info it provided as a basis, and will continue updating based on my own knowledge + commenter feedback.) Here's what I've got:\n\n* **Sam Wilson/Captain America**: poised to lead the Avengers in Doomsday, following the events of BNW\n* **Torres/Falcon**: after teaming up with Sam in BNW, he was invited to the Avengers.\n* **Hulk**: He was last seen introducing his son Skaar to his family at the end of She-Hulk.\n* **Thor**: Active and ready to defend Earth, probably hangin primarily in Asgard.\n* **Loki:** We last saw him take on the responsibility of maintaining the timelines himself as the God of Stories, after the failure of the Temporal Loom. \n* **Valkyrie**: Likely taking care of business in New Asgard.\n* **Dr Strange**: Currently absent from the confirmed Doomsday lineup. Last we saw him, he grew a third eye and went to help Clea in the Dark Dimension.\n* **Wong**: The current Sorcerer Supreme. likely splitting time between Sanctum Sanctorum and Kamar-Taj. \n* **Scarlet Witch**: Last seen sacrificing herself to destroy the Darkhold. Whether or not she survived the blast is unknown, but one can assume she's out there somewhere.\n* **Wiccan/Billy Maximoff**: After the events of Agatha All Along, he and Agatha are searching for his brother, Tommy.\n* **Agatha Harkness**: After the events of her show she's now a ghost, traveling with Wiccan.\n* **White Vision**: At the end of Wandavision, Hex Vision transfers all of True Vision's memories into White Vision. Overwhelmed, he flies away- current whereabouts unknown.\n* **Spidey**: Despite the world forgetting his identity, Peter remains active in New York. Collabs with other heros may prove tricky now.\n* **Hawkeye**: Probably posted up with his family, hoping he can retire in peace.\n* **Nick Fury**: In space, overseeing SABER.\n* **War Machine**: Was liberated from a Skrull facility during Secret Invasion. Is likely being rehabilitated still, as we don't know how long he was been imprisoned for.\n* **Ant-Man**: Following his adventures in the Quantum Realm, Scott is back to his everyday life.\n* **Wasp**: Same as Scott, probably.\n* **Ant-Girl/Cassie**: Same as Scott and Wasp.\n* **Guardians of the Galaxy**: Likely remaining off world and far from any conflicts involving Earth. Doing their own thing.\n* **Star-Lord**: Following Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Peter Quill is probably chillin on Earth still.\n* **Black Panther**: Shuri recreated the heart shaped herb, and formed a tentative alliance with Namor and his people.\n* **Namor**: Last seen licking his wounds after the loss to the Wakandans.\n* **Shang-Chi**: We last saw him getting briefed by Wong on the rings emitting some kind of beacon to someone or something far away. He's probably back to his usual life for now, in between training/briefing sessions with Wong.\n* **Captain Marvel**: After the events of The Marvels, Carol is likely dealing with various crises out in space, as she waits for Monica's potential return.\n* **Monica Rambeau**: stranded in an alternate universe, Monica's return is anticipated, especially with her connection to the several confirmed X-Men so far.\n* **Ms. Marvel**: Kamala was last seen initiating the formation of the Young Avengers, by recruiting Kate Bishop.\n* **Kate Bishop**: Last seen getting recruited by Kamala.\n* **Moon Knight**: last seen with Konshu, picking up the villain Arthur Harrow as one of Marc's alters- Jake Lockley\n* **Scarlet Scarab/Layla**: became the avatar of Tawaret (hippo lady), probably returned to NY and is doing somewhat normal things in between avatar summons.\n* **She-Hulk**: last seen balancing her personal life and professional life, with her superpowers under control, at the end of her show\n* **Echo**: Seemingly at peace with how things concluded in her show, I would assume she made her way back to NYC, but she could still be in Oklahoma.\n* **Daredevil**: fighting crime in NY (i assume? i havent seen Born Again yet)\n* **Punisher**: ? (see above, havent seen Born Again yet)\n* **Swordsman**: Imprisoned by Kingpin\n* **Kingpin/Wilson Fisk**: current mayor of NYC, who most recently placed NYC into martial lockdown to solidify his power\n* **The Eternals**: Some are in space, last seen with Eros, and the others have been taken by Arishem to face judgment for humanity and to see if Earth is worthy of existing.\n* **Ironheart**: Returned to MIT (without her suit she used in the battle against Namor's forces).\n* **America Chavez**: Training as a sorcerer in Kamar-Taj.\n* **Deadpool**: After his adventure with Wolverine, he's probably back to \"normal\" (doing absurd Deadpool shit and breaking the 4th wall)\n* **Wolverine**: Having saved the day with Deadpool, he's probably now trying to carve out some sense of normalcy in the MCU universe\n* **Jack Russell/Werewolf by night**: Reunited with Ted (Man-Thing), the two are likely laying low.\n* **Ted Sallis/Man-Thing**: Reunited with Russell (werewolf). \n* **Elsa Bloodstone**: Presumably ruling over Bloodstone Manor (and making changes).\n* **The Thunderbolts**: Assuming they don't all get smoked in their movie, they're likely ready for more action.\n* **The Fantastic Four**: Like the Thunderbolts, we can assume they will join the action in some way- my theory being that they come here from another universe.", "They will address it in Doomsday, some of them haven't appeared on-screen in years, both in-universe and real life time.", "Doing other stuff offscreen.\n\nThe events of Thunderbolts take place in just a short period.

I\u2019d have cut Red Guardian and Taskmaster from the team. I don\u2019t really like Taskmaster as a member of the Thunderbolts, I prefer Taskmaster being a straight up villain, even if Taskmaster isn\u2019t the best in the MCU, and as for Red Guardian, I\u2019d much rather him be on the Winter Guard, with Crimson Dynamo, Ursa Major and Darkstar. For the members who I\u2019m not adding to the team, I know that Zemo is the guy who led the original Thunderbolts team, with villains posing as heroes, but this clearly isn\u2019t that story, so that rules out Goliath, Fixer, Beetle, Screaming Mimi and Moonstone, and with Val in the picture, there\u2019d be no point in having Ross show up, which also rules out his team, so no Agent Venom, Ghost Rider, Deadpool, Punisher and Elektra, although many of them wouldn\u2019t have been ready to be on that team yet, as for two members I have toyed around with, but can\u2019t find a place for them, Justin Hammer, Whiplash and Bullseye, they just wouldn\u2019t work.

John still has the fallout of his short time as Captain America to deal with, he was never ready and he killed someone in anger with the shield, but can he do some good as U.S. Agent? Yelena\u2019s been free from the Red Room for almost a decade, but she still doesn\u2019t know how to move on and find a new life for herself. Bucky might have finally been able to move on from his actions as the Winter Soldier, but what can he do now? Ava is finally in a stable state where she can control her powers, she isn\u2019t slowly dying anymore, she\u2019s not S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s weapon anymore, but what good can she do? Emil might have moved on from what he did as the Abomination in the past, even trying to counsel other past criminals into changing their ways, but the public will always see him as the monster who destroyed Harlem in the battle with the Hulk, can he restore his reputation?

But when you have a character like Zemo (a top 5 Marvel villain) and an actor like Bruhl and don\u2019t use them in the perfect story for them\u2026.its a misstep.

His whole thing was tearing down the Avengers,  he thinks people with powers eventually start thinking that they\u2019re above people who don\u2019t have powers. And He\u2019s got too much blood on his hands to redeem in any way that makes sense.", "Watched it yesterday, and the movie itself is good. It does a very good job of subverting a lot of MCU cliches (briefly: the problem is not solved with punching, the bad guy is not a mirror version of the main character, it is both ensemble and has a central protagonist, the resolution is complex and not a return to the movie or universe's status quo).\n\nGiven what they did with Zemo, I don't think he would have worked in the JLD role from a logistics point of view. It would have eaten up a fair amount of screen time to set that up and it would have distracted from the core of the movie, which is mental health and loneliness (it works way better than you'd expect). And this isn't quite Dark Avengers, thematically, even if it is close: Norman held the cards on that one (except with Bob) while this one ends with a different power balance.\n\nThat said, you are 100% correct that Bruhl and the Zemo character he made is in the top tier of MCU antagonists and it is a shame that they couldn't do a Thunderbolts movie that capitalized on that. Bruhl really kills it in that role, and the writing managed to make him complex enough that he could work as an villain, hero or anti-hero, something that a Thunderbolts movie could have done all in one story.\n\nI quite like what we got, but you're right, it's still vaguely a shame for people who know about the comics.", "But he never had a chance to become interesting. I remember how excited I was when I saw him in Winter Soldier, and then he just died and I still can't understand why. Did we really need that scene from Civil War? \n\nAh, well. You're right, he should have been a key part ;(", "And that Flag Smasher Karli Morgenthau character shoulda been the redhead Sin, of course with a spin-off outcome.", "Yeah, I'm pretty sure he just walked away from the fight after Wanda threw him at the building and all the fire and destruction in that building happened just because he was so hot. Then he lived happily ever after in Nigeria. Either this or I'll explode myself.", "I really don't understand why they killed him off.", "Could have been Sharon as the surprise Taskmaster replacement.", "I agree, but I think there's something to be said for that potentially contributing to the overall team dynamic. \n\nHe might actually see some appeal in joining a team like the thunderbolts based on his whole need for a 'north star' as season 3 of DD shows.", "He's also ex-militarty, they could've made it work.", "I went into the reasoning, but basically I cut out Red Guardian and Taskmaster and replaced the both of them with Abomination", "Snowflame, The Black Bomber", "That\u2019s not what I mean. Professor Hulk is in control of himself, so is Guru Abomination.\nBoth are supposed to be monsters.", "Well, it is based (sort of, a little) on the original Ultimate universe, where basically everything was a result of trying to make wanna be Caps.", "Damn it I'm in.", "He also wrote a very influential book called The You You Are", "True. But this team, and Val\u2019s presence, does not resemble anything even remotely akin to any iteration of the Thunderbolts. And what we know about them is basically Dark Avengers (only they aren\u2019t really dark and none of the moral ambiguity of Dark Avengers would be applicable here). \n\nLike I said, if Feige wants to make Dark Avengers that\u2019s fine. Defensible, even. He is clearly drawing a lot of inspiration from 2005-2020 Marvel comics, so sure, use the Dark Avengers. If he doesn\u2019t want to use Norman because he thinks Dafoe did it so well it can never be topped, then fine. I\u2019ll begrudgingly accept that (even though I consider it lazy and probably a cover story because Sony won\u2019t let Marvel use Norman outside of Spidey movies). Use Val as the founder of the Dark Avengers, if you must. \n\nBut FFS, to use the Thunderbolts as a decoy name to cover a twist anyone could see telegraphed from the moment this was announced\u2026.I take issue with THAT.", "I don\u2019t think he has too much blood. Loki killed thousands. And, yes, the Infinity Stone corrupted him. But let\u2019s be real. That was a retcon because the character became popular. Plus Zemo was among the most well liked parts of F&WS. Factor in Br\u00fchl\u2019s charisma and the character could easily be redeemed. \n\nEspecially given his sympathetic motive. Effectively, he sets up the Thunderbolts in the guise of doing good, but in reality is pitting metas against one another. Basically using some meta humans to kill others. But by working with his team, he realizes his way was wrong and becomes a genuine hero.\n\nThis is a story we already dipped the toe into the pool on with his \u201cI\u2019ve decided not to kill you\u201d line to Sam at the end of F&WS. It\u2019s just the natural conclusion of his story.", "Kellyman definitely could\u2019ve made for an interesting Sin.", "It would make exactly as much sense as him walking away after getting t-boned by a helicarrier.", "Because the MCU _loves_ killing off their villains.  They're getting _mildly_ better about it, but it's been a major issue from Iron Man 1.", "Abomination has _always_ been more in control of himself.  Blonsky himself isn't (wasn't) the most stable, but he's _never_ been on par with Hulk (in the movies).", "The fun with Zemo though is that he\u2019s unrepentant about his actions. He did what did cause he has to and he\u2019ll do it again without hesitation. Sounds like ruining one of the best villains in the MU for the sake of forcing \u201cwell it happened in the books\u201d. \n\nAnd with the Loki example well they cheated but the character needed to \u201cdie\u201d first to even get a chance at redemption. \n\nMaybe you can have him recruit the team and have the team decide they actually like being heroes and turn on him ?", "Maybe, but I don\u2019t think it is necessarily diminishing of Zemo. I think you can maintain his moral ambiguity by having him remain someone who is willing to go to extensive extremes and manipulate to sociopathic degrees to kill super humans whom he does not see the value of. He has a sense of morality but still views himself as superior enough to be judge, jury, and executioner (just because of their genetics). \n\nHe can remain morally ambiguous without being full blown villain. In fact, with the X-Men on the horizon, and the issue with mutants being born with their powers, having a protagonist (ie not hero, but protagonist) who denies their right to exist absent them meeting some moral code he has defined is an interesting conflict between characters the audience is rooting for in separate contexts.\n\nHonestly, it would be the most interesting thing Marvel has done in years."], "category": "hot"}

In this case Reed & co were recruited for a secret project to create a warp drive enabling interstellar travel. An early subplot here is that Reed & Sue had already cracked the hard drive but lied to SHIELD for weeks about setbacks because they discovered it had been infiltrated by Hydra and they didn\u2019t want that power in Hydra\u2019s hands. This prompts them to hijack the ship that was built for the drive and go themselves. \n\nWe then get the cosmic storm which will be revealed to have been caused by Annihilus\u2019 cosmic control rod tying the F4 getting their powers to Annihilus. Both of these ideas specifically but this pitch as a whole were inspired by a YouTube video I just watched but can\u2019t remember the name of. \n\nWe then get to act 2 where we are now on an alien world that\u2019s super advanced. This serves to give the movie its space exploration element but also sets up the multiversal tie in to future MCU movies. Before being rescued the idea is that when the storm knocked them off course it sent them into orbit around a blackhole where they were in stasis for some time before being rescued but due to time dilation around this black hole over a decade had passed on earth so that this would explain why the F4 hadn\u2019t existed in the MCU to date."], "category": "hot", "linkTitle": "Too Many Requests"}

Antonia should've just been another Widow, IMO.\n\nBut I loved Yelena, her relationship with Nat, their FX's *The Americans*\\-style fake spy family trauma with Melina and Alexei, and that harrowing title sequence with Malia J's version of Smells Like Teen Spirit, to name a few things.\n\nHope we see what happened to the other Widows.

Everything else was fine to me.", "To me they should make Armor Wars and kill Rhodey in it. It would be pretty shocking in good way.

I don't think many people would wind up feeling totally lost if that was their first introduction to the characters.\n\nIt reminds me of how people worried that both Wandavision and Ms Marvel would be \"required viewing\" to be able to understand The Marvels, but Carol hadn't seen Monica in decades, so obviously a talk about how she suddenly has powers now was going to have to happen (which covers Monica's relevant plot points from Wandavision), and none of these characters had ever met Kamala before, so she was naturally going to end up introducing herself and explaining what her deal is (which covers any relevant information you would have needed from Ms Marvel).", "Plus, if you want to keep going, you get Fury and Carol to carry you through.", "I treat it as canon, I know it probably isn't though. \nI treat Season 1-5 as part of the sacred timeline, then Endgame and Loki unlock the Multiverse allowing for 6&7 to take place in an alternate timeline.", "Bitter?

In the comics, it was a years-long sort of examination in which it was revealed that lots of fan favorite characters had been skrulls for years, featuring major superheroes and overall just being this dreadful thriller. The show was kind of more of a quiet drama about Nick Fury finding out that Rhodey was a skrull... and that was the extent of the \"thrills.\" It's really not a terrible show, but it's a terrible adaptation, and people who tuned in for Secret Invasion are pissed off about it.", "That\u2019s all true, but the humor and emotions all work because you\u2019ve spent that time investing in them, even if you missed dark world.

I wonder why only 8 reviews are showing up though when I click view all reviews. Maybe it\u2019s a mobile site issue.", "The reason why the score is hidden is because RT is all about the Tomatometer. They used to display more detail, but now they've reduced it to their simpler branded metric. It's not really a question of which is more accurate, because they measure different things.\n\nBut you make a good point - someone who rates out of 4 is giving a rating with less precision. If they give it a 3/4 they may have leaned towards a 14 or 16 out of 20 had they used that system. We don't know. But we do know they gave it a 3/4, which is mathematically equal to 15/20. I think that's a totally reasonable assumption to make when aggregating reviews.\n\nThe way I would treat letters would be to transfer it to a numerical system by counting the number of possible letter grades and then seeing where a given grade fits in that system. Someone who uses letters A-F (with no + or -) uses a system with 6 possible grades. A is a 6/6, B is a 5/6, etc.\n\nIs that how they treated letters? I don't actually know. How did they treat reviews without grades or ratings? I don't know either - they probably counted towards the Tomatometer but not the average rating?\n\nYou could argue that in unifying ratings, the aggregator is making assumptions, but that's also true of the Tomatometer.

He kept looking at it and that\u2019s why they went back to the straps. Vibranium itself wouldn\u2019t react to magnets so there were extra metal pieces added in place of the strap.

For the few minutes before it's given to Bruce, Cap is probably already there and could even be just climbing the stairs while that conversation is happening.  If anything, that universe momentarily had two Time, Space, and Mind stones until the Avengers and Loki departed earlier in the film, returning the count to one of each.", "Wait when did it get pruned?", "Perhaps some of the ones the TVA has are the ones cap tried to return but couldn't", " No. Bruce promised to bring it back and prevent this timeline from ever happening.", "I secretly think Steve met Kang (or another time-hopping being) and was able to circumvent the rules somehow.\n\nThough I'm still confused as to the reasons usually sited that Old Cap shouldn't be there at all?", "How could \u201cold cap\u201d live with Peggy and make it back to Sam with his shield if that reality got pruned?", "He went to a nearly identical timeline where other avengers took the stones, and he returned these other stones.", "Right, you have to think of \"Loki grabs tesseract\" as another branching, and *that branch* got yanked.", "I think the final battle has a unique dirty look, but yes a lot of it is very graywashed.", "Or 2012 Cap accidentally bringing Covid to 2012.

Therefore there will be tiny, microscopic dings and imperfections, and the older one will benever so slightly lighter just because of entropy and atoms lost every time it hits something hard.  Not to mention the coloring isn't vibraniun and gets scratched over time.  I think Steve would notice.", "That does make me wonder, though: what's the recoat process?  Does the old enamel get lasered off first?", "I believe it was the shield itself, \u2018cause vibranium claws can scratch vibranium\n\nMaybe Tony superheated it and smoothed out the marks?", "This is what I thought, the marks were purely cosmetic and only scratched the paint and other coating on the front of the shield.", "True.

It is an entirely different shield.", "Yes, but from where?  I want to see that story.", "Bullets wouldn't stick to the outside of the shield on the opposite site of the magnet, as both lead and copper (the two primary components in bullets being a lead core and a copper jacket) are not ferromagnetic.", "If you watch pretty closely in the opening scene, I believe you can see that there is a mount of some kind on the back of capsule hand and his forearm that the shield latches onto.", "\"that thing does not obey the laws of physics, at all\"\n\n, \ud83e\udd37", "Unless it's an electromagnet that can be activated and deactivated.", "Well no. It was an activated magnet that\u2019s the only way he\u2019d be able to call it back like that. I mean obviously there\u2019s some magic fuckery because a magnet would not have that kind of range. But there is real technology out there where you can \u201cactive and deactivate\u201d for lack of a better word, a certain type of magnet", "You are right", "In the comics there was an electromagnet. Cap removes it because it messed the balance of the shield when thrown.", "So I looked into it and apparently in the comics vibranium is explicitly not magnetic (which would necessitate adding the magnet to the shield itself) while the MCU has portrayed vibranium reacting to magnets in several contexts.", "I never noticed that! My bad!", "He used it when fighting Spider-man, you can hear the same whirr in addition for Peter calling bullshit on its physics, iirc", "A second split happens when Loki goes pretty much right?\n\nHulk takes the stone, a second later Cap appears and returns the stone, no split timeline, Loki takes off with the stone the timeline branches off.", "Yeah cuz remember Loki accused the Avengers and Ravonna said they were meant to go back in time", "Right after they capture loki after he teleports", "Highly unlikely, since this timeline was pruned. But intriguing idea.", "Probably, to put on a shiny new fresh one.", "If there were a line showing where Thanos ripped away the shield, that would have been awesome.", "You're right - I misunderstood. \n\nHowever, I think that if the shield were to decay like that, then long (LONG) before the shield disintegrated, the two shields would no longer be identical (one would have way more wear and tear), and 2023 Steve would then probably not grab the wrong shield, ending the loop. So a single shield might make many loops, but I think they would always end up escaping the loop. \n\nThis isn't even taking shield repairs into consideration, or the fact that a 2023 Steve would probably not take an almost entirely decayed shield back in time.", "I mean, yeah. My personal guess is Steve sought out the Wakandans using his knowledge of the future and asked of them to create a new shield for Sam, and that's why the one Steve gives to Sam has greeble lines on the silver ring", "Read this in Walter White's voice.", "And even if they were magnetic, you would need an insanely strong magnet to stop and hold a bullet from the speed it's moving at.", "B b b bb", "I think he lost it because it was one of the toys and gadgets funded by shield, which was dismantled in the winter soldier movie. my timeline could be way off though so idk lol", "You can see in the beginning fight of Civil War that the straps are back when Cap drops his shield chasing after Crossbones. The magnetic device was also part of the costume in Age of Ultron, which you don\u2019t see at all in Civil War.\n\nThe sound you hear is just the shield returning. If it was the magnetic device, Cap wouldn\u2019t need to catch it, it would just go to his arm.", "Yep, and the second timeline Loki creates is pruned as soon as he\u2019s arrested.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t really explain how Tony getting hit by hulk and the space stone being knocked loose is fixed in the 2012 timeline though.", "Yup you're right. No split is supposed to happen when Cap returns the stone but when Loki flees it created a branch and that is supposed to be pruned", "Oh wow you're right I was thinking that was a different universe", "If it was pruned how did they put the stones back?", "Yeah! Science, bitch", "Maybe an O shaped magnet, I think I\u2019ll call it the Magnet-O", "Yeah, the timeline is off because Age of Ultron was after Winter Soldier and he would\u2019ve had it during Winter Soldier.", "He doesn't create another timeline he just teleports to another place within that timeline", "There must be a timeline where hulk hits tony and the space stone isnt stolen by Loki but rather returned to the proper avengers in that timeline. These events still force our avengers to go back to the 70s to get a second chance at stealing the space stone. And then there is one where the space stone is stolen by Loki leading to the events of \u201cLoki\u201d", "For that I have to assume that Hulk getting the time stone happens before the events at Stark Tower and the second Hulk's away, Cap immediately appears so at one moment in time there were two time stones in that timeline.", "It was pruned after they put the stones back\u2026. Did you not watch Loki?", "Yeah, so that gets pruned, but you\u2019d still either have to redo the part where the stone gets loose or figure out a different way for tony and Steve to have to go back to the 70\u2019s, otherwise what happens to that space stone after that timeline is pruned?", "Or loki escaping sends him on a path to become a hero and it also sends tony on a path to becoming doom", "It wasn\u2019t pruned. Steve returned the stones. Both the 2012 avengers and future of them 2022 avengers time traveling to the past and back didn\u2019t (according to what Ramona said in the first episode of Loki) constitute a crime against the sacred timeline so it wasn\u2019t pruned.\n\nLoki using the tesseract created a new timeline which was rapidly pruned by the TVA. The films\nDidn\u2019t go back and show us the scene of the non pruned sacred timeline where Loki didn\u2019t pick up and use the tesseract because it would have been redundant as we\u2019d already seen all the movies and the fate of Loki in the post 2012 films", "This timeline wasn't pruned. This timeline started to deviate but then returned a few seconds later when Cap arrived to return their time stone. Another new timeline split off when Loki escaped with the Tesseract, and THAT is the timeline that got pruned.", "I\u2019ve watched Loki twice and don\u2019t remember the scene you\u2019re talking about", "It goes in the paperweight drawer along with all the rest of them", "But\u2026 Loki uses the Tesseract *because* the 2023 Avengers caused him to get it\n\nHow is there a timeline where the 2023 Avengers travel back and the same events play out but Loki doesn\u2019t use the Tesseract he gets?", "God this shit is so fucking headache inducing lmao, like I understand the logic, but my brain literally can't let go of the way we see it carry on from the point in Endgame, like the continuous-ness of it trips me up", "The TVA pruned the branch that this Loki had created by using the tesseract.", "It\u2019s the very beginning, after Loki escapes with the Tesseract\n\nThe TVA show up and prune his timeline", "But then there is just a new reality that doesn\u2019t have a space stone no matter what Steve does\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the way they bring doom into this anyway lol. Which would actually be kinda clever writing- lokis actions lead him to becoming the hero and also leads to a version of tony that is evil.", "Because that timeline is the original timeline we saw in the first Avengers film.\n\nIn Infinity War/Endgame The Avengers returned the stones, correcting every change they made to the past, thus preventing new branches, meaning their futures remained the same, and the timeline remained the same, including the events of all the films we\u2019d seen up until that point, *except* for Loki escaping in New York.\n\nThe TVA fixed that by erasing the branched timeline Loki created leaving the original timeline where he didn\u2019t escape with the tesseract \n\nThus the entire timeline as we\u2019ve seen it play out in all the films up until Infinity War/Endgame remains the same", "Because Steve returned the stone to 1970. \n\nRemember, in the actual sacred timeline, Thor ends up with the tesseract at the end of *Avengers*, as it has to be on Asgard all the way up until the end of *Ragnarok* so Thanos can steal it at the start of *Infinity War*.", "Which is not the timeline we were talking about", "And that timeline is not the one I\u2019m talking about.

Loved the mental health theme and how balance I feel the action and the dialogue was!!!!", "Great film. I honestly wish it was longer cause my only real gripe is that the actual meat of the film has to make way for the usual action scenes and setup. Feel like if they actually gave the substance time to breath it would have been an instant 10/10.\n\nRly feels like an A24 version of GotG in a good way and I hope this film does well at the box office because it rly is one of the better recent MCU films imo (including GotG3 and Shang chi). It still has its MCUisms but it\u2019s noticeably less prominent. It\u2019s very visually distinct from classic mcu that\u2019s for sure.\n\nAlso, Bucky is the best.", "Watched in Hong Kong. Although marketed as mostly a standalone with lesser known characters, it felt much closer to films from Phase 1-3 in their lead up to Infinity War, with this setting up Doomsday.\n\n>!The Russos are great at separating and balancing giant ensembles, with multiple parties at different locations in Infinity War.

In recent years.. \n\nMakes me wanting more of this team..", "Just finished watching it. I was the only one who stayed for the end credits, people just left after the mid credits. 8/10 for me. Would have loved to see more of the other characters because I felt like they focused a lot on Yelena.", "The big question nobody's asking yet is: Who's Sam Wilson assembling?! Sounds like he's got a team in the post credits. I'm guessing it'd be everyone from the Shang Chi post credits, maybe Spidey. Funny how they couldn't just merge the two teams though.", "Something that I haven't seen people discuss is the Marvel Studios opening logo animation. \n\nFor some reason they used the old animation with the comic book pages flipping through the logo instead of the one they've used in the last 9 years with the animation starting from storyboards, scripts and then scenes from past movies.\n\nWith Captain America: Brave New World also didn't use the opening logo animation at all, I'm curious on why they're doing that this year. Are they maybe slowly introducing a new opening logo animation for next year's Avengers movie?", "I loved it. It felt different but in a good way. Agree with others on this thread that I wish we saw more of the other characters rooms though, especially Bucky, but I did appreciate the joke he made after!", "BTW I'm actually a little bummed they didn't just keep using Thunderbolts. I mean I get it with \"New Avengers\", but I liked the other name more.\u00a0", "I really enjoyed it! It felt back to basics. No multiverse and no stunt cameos. Florence is excellent! Just a nice solid movie and I hope they continue in this direction.", "One of the most moving MCU movies, and so, one of the very best. \n\nThe explosions and fights and physical struggles and humour and powers and punching etc etc were all very well done, but it was the emotional moments that really lifted this into the top tier. \n\nOther MCU movies may have had this scene or that scene with more spectacle, or a more shocking surprise, or a more exhilarating fight, or funnier dialog, but there are precious few with moments that are more powerfully moving. \n\nAnyone who had a tough childhood, or who has done things they're ashamed of, or has ever felt alone or that life is pointless - in short, any human being with an ounce of introspection - will experience some intensely relatable resonances with these characters.", "The Bob hug scene unexpectedly touch my soul", "the asterisk is for the movie\u2019s actual title being \u201cDefibrillators\u201d because it just zapped the MCU\u2019s heartbeat back to life", "One thing I really missed that they really stopped doing happened here, and it's them scrambling to save civilians. Usually, in the third act, it's heroes vs. villains. Here, like it or not, they are heroes. They are serving the people. I really had fun with this\u2014I hope it ages well.", "The \"B-vengers\" headline in the credits was actually hilarious \ud83e\udd23 \n\nI like the amount of humour that was in the movie, not overbearing like Thor 4 but just right and felt natural. David Harbour killed it with Red Guardian's over-enthusiasm in making sure Thunderbolts became a thing.", "Poor taskmaster", "I was only hyped for this movie a few weeks ago but damn, this is actually one of the best recent MCU films. Felt like a much needed change from the recent MCU shenanigans, just good plot, good pacing, and good acting. Even though I wasn't hyped at first, I knew Florence would absolutely deliver.. and she did. I did not expect to feel some emotions while watching but damn.\n\nOnly slight nitpick for me was the lack of others' visions when they went into the void, would have loved to see even just a glimpse of it  but it would have dragged the 3rd act. A solid 8/10 for me\n\nAlso I need more of Bob.", "Very enjoyable film. Bob is absolutely awesome, powerful, terrifying and sympathetic.\n\nHonestly didn't want it to end. Really want to spend more time with all of these people.", "Valentina\u2019s comment about Bucky barely getting through half a term.

More like Masktaster.\u201d *Phases Taskmaster\u2019s mask through her head and stops midway.*", "My favorite phase five project for now (recency bias lol) even though I love Agatha All Along and Loki S2. Will watch it a second time in theater to let it sink in but I love it and Florence Pugh is amazing.", "8/10 from me", "This might be the best political satire Marvel ever made", "Honestly really impressed/shocked how well they handled portraying bi polar / depression and how to deal with it. \n\nI feel like this movie will underperform because it hasn\u2019t got a real marketable draw without massive spoilers. But sentry\u2019s fight scene in the tower was really visually cool and well done. It would be nice if this was the kick off for new marvel and not the last movie for the previous 5 years mess, even if this was kind of what everything had been building to", "I really, really hope Marvel doesn\u2019t sit on this team for years after Secret Wars. Let them be a huge part of the next era moving forward, we desperately need the consistency.", "The first movie since Captain Marvel where the post credit scene is related to the next movie", "100% loved this movie. Perfect balance between action, emotion and comedy. It's up there next to Winter Soldier for me. Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman are the MVPs. Even though the rest are mostly side characters, I did feel like they could have shown a bit of Bucky and Ava's \"void\" scenes and them confronting their dark pasts (Bucky as the Winter Soldier and Ava as an assassin/spy for SHIELD). Taskmaster was basically a one-line cameo who got her ass beat.\n\nSecond post-credit scene really felt like we're brought back to early Marvel days where we're teased with something that's actually important. I think this movie exceeded all expectations and the Director did a great job because it wasn't trying to be a cameo-fest/fan service movie like Multiverse of Madness/D&W and they didn't reveal everything about Sentry/Void before the movie came out (vs Red Hulk in BNW).\n\nAlso I'm so glad they didn't go with the final third act being a big CGI fight. I'm actually rooting for this team and can't wait to see more of them.", "What a phenomenal film, not only as a Marvel production but just an inherently brilliant movie overall. Absolutely loved the allegorical plot of mental health in different forms and stages amongst all of the main cast. They bounced off each other comedically and emotionally far better than I could have imagined. \n\nI haven\u2019t read a huge amount of Sentry/Void stories but it is a beautiful depiction of the horrors associated with PTSD, schizophrenia, and anxiety. That character and storyline was a perfect fit for the Thunderbolts and what the movie wanted to achieve.\n\nIn terms of being a Marvel movie, this was very unique in the context of the MCU but it worked so well. The A24 film comparisons are spot on. It didn\u2019t need the spectacle that other highly rated MCU movies have, its success came from the emotional crescendo. The pacing felt just right, and the third act was an extremely well crafted culmination. \n\nYelena and Bob certainly stole the show both plot and performance wise. Both actors deserve awards for this and I really hope that being a Marvel movie doesn\u2019t discount them. The scene in which Yelena pours her heart out to Alexei might be the single best piece of acting in the MCU to date, Florence Pugh absolutely killed it. I cannot wait to see more of Bob and really hope he plays a major part moving forward to Doomsday, Secret Wars and beyond. \n\nThe only gripes I may have are that Ava/Ghost felt a little out of place. It just felt like her absence wouldn\u2019t have made a whole lot of difference. I really think the movie could have done with an extra 10 minutes to show what the other Thunderbolts saw in The Void. Which leads me to my next point in Bucky, who served well as a mentor and unifier of the team but took a bit of a backseat plot wise.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favourite MCU films to date. I honestly would not even want to try to rank them anymore as it would be far too difficult. If it came down to critically rating them all, I absolutely feel like Thunderbolts is top 5. Also, the credits scenes were top tier. Sooooo hyped for what\u2019s to come.", "Props to Red Guardian turning his limo into a hobo man's Batmobile. The slowpoke speed, and molotov cocktail as a defensive countermeasure was funny.", "I see why there's a positive buzz around this film... it's actually about something human and relatable. Much like Tony dealing with PTSD in Iron Man 3 but on a much more sincere stage. It's a very character driven film and the misfits are more than surface level broken. It's great to see one of these films commit to such a positive message (good friends can help you defeat the darker aspects of your character and personality) while actually committing to a visual metaphor of dark depression... and there's some great superhero fights too!\n\nUS Agent still carrying his taco shield 14months later was the icing on the cake. Top tier MARVEL.", "14 months later: WIGS", "I really like the parallel of Natasha and Bruce with Yelena and Bob.", "I was so so so worried they\u2019d repeat Suicide Squad 1\u2019s biggest mistake: having street level powered people go up against world ending threat *with no good justification or resolution*\n\nT* handled it sooooo well", "I would love to ride on Bob into the sky.", "Glad they recast Sentry. Lewis Pullman really nailed it here.", "Maybe I glitched out during the film, but in making the experimental drug that Bob took, did the government essentially make on Earth an enhanced being with power that seems maybe stronger than anyone we've seen in the MCU? I get that the Sentry's origin here is mostly the same as in the comics from what I remember. Still I was thinking that's a pretty crazy leap with Earth-bound serum/drugs without the help of some nutty cosmic artifact or advanced tech. Unless I missed something?", "Really glad they did Sentry/The Void well!", "Loved the on your left moment from Walker", "Damn I knew Taskmaster would bite the dust, but it still feels weird how they legit just got her out of the MCU right quick, and the narrative doesn't even linger on her demise.\n\n\nWell, that's one way to fix the issue of Kurylenko being 45 in real life, but playing like a 25 year old in the MCU.", "Back from the theatre.  What a blast this movie was.  Florence was amazing.  Loved the chemistry between them all.  Bucky still got his knife skills and did he look good on that motorcycle - T2 Arnie eat your heart out.  David Harbour stole every scene he was in.  I love Hannah John-kamens voice, she could read the phone book to me.  Always too to see JLD.  Everyone knocked it out of the park.  Enjoy good folks\n\nEdit, forgot to add we received a free poster on arrival.", "I did love it, but I still needed more Bucky. I don't know. I kinda feel he should be the leader, and it seemed that Yelena is unofficially leader. I do love her, though. She's one of the best new characters. \n\nIt's still a solid movie, in my humble opinion. I just loves me some Bucky.", "I liked that they leaned into the mental health x family themes instead of going balls out on action.\n\nI cried twice in the film as a DV survivor, it was so touching (it wasnt explicitly stated but in some ways the the Widow project def felt like an allegory for prostitution). The scene where it implies Bob was hiding in the attic from having to watch his father terrorize his family. It was heartbreaking.\n\nYelena admitting that she feels so fucking alone \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udec2, she easily shot up to 5 of my fav MCU ongoing story arcs so far.\n\nTHE F4 TEASER AT THE ENDDS AJHHHHH", "Genuinely very good. Fun, breezes by without a check of the watch, nor formulaic, nicely funny without trying too hard to be.\n\nMaking it a Florence Pugh film is smart, they treated all the characters well (Bucky was my fear), eliminated a supposed big player early, but having her as the real lead was good for the film and good use of the actress. She\u2019s a star. \n\nLoved Sentry. They made a big deal out of him without doing too much, and the darkness of him carried through, although others who have read more comics than me (a casual reader) probably have strong opinions there. \n\nThe end credits tease was great, so simple but made me so excited for F4! \n\nThis had no points where I felt like I was in the machine of the MCU, and none of those moments in the story where you had to force yourself to ignore the plot choices or the how, where, why of it all, which is essential and has been an issue lately.\n\nNot a No Way Home or GOTG3 classic, but a very enjoyable entry with real rewatch potential.", "Whoever directed Thunderbolts should have directed Brave New World, and should direct more Marvel movies. It had a great balance between comedy, action, shock value, emotional moments.\nThe action was good, the characters were actually interesting. \nWe should have gotten a movie like this in the earlier phases. \nAlso, that meet up scene was crazy good. Not to mention the drive through the desert. Hilarious.\n8/10.", "Soo Walker just always rocks the taco shield now? I can dig it haha", "I'm just REALLY glad there wasn't some super stupid explanation for the \\*\n\nI mean the name was kinda stupid but I thought that humour was well placed.", "This really is the A24 of the MCU. Florence Pugh brought her A game and no one is surprised, but everyone on the cast was amazing as well and meshed so perfectly together. Love the scene where everyone got together to save civilians, and making the third act not just fighting is a bold move that paid off narratively (and hopefully financially). A post credits scene setting up something coming immediately also felt rare these days, and it\u2019s such an icing on the cake. I wonder if there\u2019ll be some kind of a twist though since we are essentially spoiled that the F4 will lose their universe.", "I didn't cry when Black Widow died.\n\nI didn't cry when Iron Man died.\n\nBut I was ugly sobbing when Bob was repeatedly punching the Void. \n\n10/10 will most likely see it in cinemas again.", "Despite their dull costumes and similar powers, I never expected to leave this movie wanting them to be MY Avengers over Sam Wilson's. They really did a great job of making me like these terribly flawed and imperfect people, some who I previously loathed. Together they had great chemistry, bouncing off each other so well in combat and when conversing. Well done! So fun!", "Me before watching Thunderbolts: Who cares about them. Bunch of side characters.\n\nAfter watching it: Oh gosh give me more!! Love their chemistry! And more Bob!!", "I fucking love those end credit with magazine cover/poster homage of how hard Val push for the New Avengers and how the public \"hate\" the New Avengers", "While the tone of the movie wasn't Winter Soldier serious, it's definitely one of the darker MCU movies, with comedy that felt appropriate, not ruining the more dramatic scenes. \n\nI was pleasently surprised that Yelena was the lead of the movie. She had a great arc and the scene with her and the red guardian was really touching. The movie could've been a bit longer though since some characters felt a bit underdeveloped. \n\nAlso shoutout to Yelena for saving the guinea pig.", "I find it weird how they spoil the ending of the next film despite it being the obvious ending when dealing with Galactus and a multiverse saga", "Something else. 14 months is a long ass time. I wonder if anything in between that time will be talked about in the future. Have the New Avengers been accepted by society yet? They fight anybody else? And what has Bob been doing this whole time? What can he do since he can't really cut loose with The Void as the consequence. Really interested in how they handle him down the line.", "As a Malaysian, that shot of the Kuala Lumpur skyline backdrop after Yelena lands with her parachute was deliberately framed. In the first shot, it featured KLCC behind her while in the other shot, it has the KL tower. Two of the mpst recognisable landmarks in KL.", "\"You always make everything worse\" from Bob's mother when all he did was try to protect her.. That hit me", "8/10 feels like McU is back again", "Man I\u2019ve missed team movies so much, really think that the MCU has been worse off without them. Yelena obviously carried it, but loved what Walker brought to the dynamic. He\u2019s been one of my favourite post-endgame additions to the MCU.\n\nAnd the post credit scene was just crazy. I was spoiled by the credits referencing their theme, but was still fantastic to see their logo appear.\n\nYelena mentioned the \u201cspace crisis\u201d, which I think is separate to the arrival of the F4? I guess we can assume that\u2019s the beginning of an incursion maybe?", "Long have I waited to see Ghost again. Shame she didn't get a ton of focus, she has quite the traumatic past we could have witnessed in the Void but I'm glad she had a decent role nevertheless.\u00a0 \u00a0", "this genuinely had one of the best third acts ive seen in a superhero movie. it didnt have a lot of action but it hit the notes that mattered", "WE MUST PROTECT OUR SWEET BOY BOB", "That scene of Bucky fighting with Sentry? The knife swap and then that gun shot to the shin? \n\nIt was so good. It shows he could have killed almost anyone if he wanted to.", "Did Taskmaster have any lines?", "Poor Walker. 14 months later, and he's still hauling around that taco shield.\n\n\nBTW, no way the four of them are group waltzing up that narrow shaft for that long with Bob's sweaty feet as leverage. Doesn't matter much, because that entire sequence was still awesome, and funny.", "Awww man in a few days there will be a contingent of folks putting this movie on a spitroast labeling it as \"woke\" because it tackles mental health as the big bad instead of the standard finale brawl. I can understand that thought process, but at the same time it'd be a bit too radicalized.\u00a0", "currently in South Korea and just finished it. Solid 8/10, post credit scene got me hyped", "Yup watched it in Hong Kong a few hours ago. Think the movie structure is solid and not like some Marvel tin-can production. This movie obviously has heart, and she's called Yelena. Florence Plugh once again nailed it (was that ever a doubt?). The other characters are given time to shine too, but Yelena and Bob steal the show.\n\nOverall imho it's a 8. And yes I agree it's the best since End Game. Can't wait to see how the next phase of MCU goes.", "\u201cAmerican Humane Society monitored some of the animals on set. No animals were harmed in those scenes.\u201d  \n  \nI\u2019m sorry what?", "First we thunder, then we bolts \n\nI liked it 7.something out of 10 I guess?", "Oh god that Sentry fight was peak perfection. It made me look past at his actual sheer force being not used, but at least finally in cinema we got someone unbeatable. \n\nThat was amazing", "i got accidentally spoiled by the own movie when the credits were rolling and in the music section they mentioned \"Fantastic Four: The First Steps\" and i said wait this didn't play anywhere in the movie, and then i knew it would have a post credit scene and what would be about\u00a0", "I really like Sentry in the comics but I was nervous if they could pull him off without nerfing him or make him a joke like they sometimes do with characters in the MCU. But they nailed the character IMO, and we got to see just enough of his powers to understand how powerful he is. As someone with bipolar disorder Bob's character really resonated with me. My favorite new MCU character. A fantastic performance by Pullman and great chemistry with Florence.", "You know since Moon Knight showed split personalities are cosmically recognised as their own persons, it\u2019s interesting that the Void or the Sentry side could count as their own persons and souls per MCU cosmology right now.\n\nAlso Bob should totally meet Moon Knight", "Most powerful sis in the universe\n\nBig sis lulls the Hulk\n\nLil sis hugs the Void", "Seeing the trailer I thought what bullshit Marvel will pull from their ass to defeat The Void, what we got is a good execution of the story.\n\n\nAnd yeah that end credit scene will be one important thing going forward. Probably Doomsday will start on that point.", "Kinda happy Bob didn\u2019t kill himself to stop the void since they are the same being. \n\nCould you imagine if the clinically depressed character saved the day through suicide\u2026", "Definitely an amazing project! I already loved Yelena but now she's one of my favorites. Florence Pugh's acting is incredible. Hoping to see another movie with this team after Secret Wars!", "7/10! Can sneak up to a 7.5!\n\nIt i indeed a breath of fresh air in the MCU, and the direct setup for the next movie gave me \"good ol' MCU vibes\"!\n\nI will say this. I do think the movie and the plot was predictable. No big surprise twists in my opinion. But unlike other MCU movies with a predictable plot, it was well-written and well-executed. And yet, while the plot was predictable, it sticks the landing. And it never went astray from the plot either. It was one smooth line from start to finish, with perfect pacing.\n\nThe scene where Bucky is going after them, was my first moment of feeling the MCU is back. That scene, for some reason, stood out for me, gave me goosebumps and made me think \"we are so back!\"\n\nClearly, Yelena and Bob are the main characters. And they execute it so well. The dynamic between the 2 of them, and also between them and the rest of the team for that matter, is great. What I slightly missed though, was a trip into the void, or into the shadows, with Red Guardian, Bucky and Ghost as well. We only have that brief moment there with Yelena and Walker. They could easily have added 10-15 minutes extra there, without it hurting the movie.\n\nNow, I did mention the plot was predictable without surprises. Yet, with that said, there was a bit of a surprising jump scare moment for me, in the scene where Yelena find Bob in the void. That took me by surprise.\n\nThe cherry on top of the cake was the end credit scene. That was hype. At first I found the whole \"Cap does not approve (of them being the Avengers), and he will form his own team\" a bit lame. Especially given his relation with Bucky. They could just join forces. But after thinking about it, it makes sense that Cap, with his moral and ethics, would not approve of them being the Avengers, sort of formed by a corrupt Valentina, also even though his friend is part of the team.", "Excellent return to form from Marvel. Sentry was as OP as he should be, and the Void was terrifying. All the stuff with Bob and Yelena was *chef\u2019s kiss*. The team dynamic is fun and interesting, all the characters grow in satisfying ways. Red Guardian is hilarious as always. It\u2019s great to see Bucky given a leadership role where he shines. The Inception-style 3rd act was perfect, the movie kept getting better and better, and then \u201cbeating\u201d the void in that way was just the perfect way to end it. 4.5/5", "Finally a Marvel movie I liked. no bullshit, some adult action scenes, they deal with depression and other fucked up stuff...\n\nthe jokes land and the camera work was mostly well done.\n\npretty nice", "NO DULL MOMENT.

There's so much heart in it, the humor wasn't out of place, the performances were great and the soundtrack was good.\n\nEasily a 9/10 for me.\n\nI do have a small nitpick: like i wish we would've gotten a bit more time in the void with others, but at the same time this is Elena's movie first and foremost and she was the \"main piece\"(at least that's how i saw it, maybe some will disagree) so i can't really complain. Florence Pugh did a fantastic job and so did everyone else(i also love MCU's version of ghost and i was kinda left wanting more, i know that it's a very niche character but hey, a girl can dream!)\n\nI'm genuinely excited for the future and i can't wait to see the team in Doomsday.", "So, Olga's name is way up in the credits (5th or 6th), considering her screen time.

Couldn\u2019t have loved it more. More than I expected, and I already went in with high expectations. I will say I loved Florence being the MVP, and I don\u2019t understand so many criticisms about Sebastian\u2019s role. It felt right. To me it felt like (at least in the origins of the team) Bucky was the head and Yelena was the heart. \n\nAlso, we know a lot about Bucky. But they needed to truly establish the other characters, and they did an amazing job at that. And when Bucky comes into play, it clicks together beautifully. I am a Bucky girlie through and through and expected to be a bit disappointed by his role, but I really enjoyed him in this film. Walker and especially Ava felt a bit sidelined and I do think we could\u2019ve done well with more of them, but it doesn\u2019t harm the film. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to feel about Sam, though. I should\u2019ve expected the MCU to mess Bucky and him up after they gave us that scene in BNW, but man. I know we lack a lot of context, and I can sort of see Sam\u2019s point, but his actions still annoyed me and felt slightly petty. Then again, we do lack context, and to know what exactly happened in the conversation between Bucky and he. Nothing good, we know. And it broke my heart to see Bucky so sad and dejected about it. His hair was looking fabulous though. \n\nLastly, I will say I really buy them as a team that cares for one another. Them coming together felt natural and earned, and as much as I loved the OG Avengers\u2026 yeah, this new team feels more like found family than OG did.", "Watched this in NZ and absolutely loved it.

That was before they even know what the shape of the first Avengers film was going to be like.\n\nYou can kind of tell how much stock was put in Ultimates and then a good stretch from New Avengers by Bendis to Secret Invasion as the cutting off point for the 2000s as a whole, and how much of it has made it to screen in the years since.\n\nFor the film, they went for a different yet similar route. They're putting the team on the map... >!again!<. No Spider-Man, no Wolverine to juice up sales like the publishing unit did back then, but a good effort is an effort worth praising.\n\nAnd as for why it's different? >!The comic New Avengers was about putting A-list characters on a B-list team.

Also, very heart-wrenching acting it felt so raw", "lmao why is Taskmaster even in this movie? They killed her off unceremoniously shortly after she appears.

I didn't expect it to deal with humans' inner struggle. If you have experienced loneliness and emptiness in your life this film is going to hit you like a rock. This is imo an \"Oscar-worthy\" film.

Overall it's Walker whom I feel the film most enhanced my appreciation for. It was nice seeing him warm up to Bob(by) over time \u2013 Bob's \"You're an asshole\" got one of the biggest audience reactions at my screening, lol.\n\nMost everything has already been said about Taskmaster so I'll just say that a part of me wonders if this isn't the last we've seen of her, as unlikely if not impossible as that sounds. Though that may just be me still being in shock over how quickly and unceremoniously she bowed out, especially when you remember what a tough life she'd already endured, as Yelena put it (not to mention her prominence in the marketing).

It felt raw and emotional. The pay off was definitely worth it,\n\n+ Acting was excellent across the board. It\u2019s so fucking nice to watch a marvel film that actually feels like a film. \n\n+ Effects were great.

None of the live action Punisher's I can recall (Dolph Lundgren, Thomas Jane, Ray Stevenson, John Bernthall) have had them, probably for that reason.  \n  \nBernthall's skull is reminiscent of the Thomas Jane Punisher skull from that movie... but I think it works better the way they adjusted it for him.  \n\nThat said, the skull that Ray Stevenson wore in his movie was comic accurate and I loved that, too. He's also the only one who really did the slicked back hair, if memory serves.   \n  \nJane's Punisher's best attribute was the trench coat but everyone had a trench coat when that movie came out so maybe it wasn't that big of a deal (Thanks, Matrix).", "To replace his comic look?

But at a time when Marvel fatigue has taken a bite out of more than one fizzled blockbuster, it\u2019s a relief to watch a comic-book movie in which the smug wisecracking is dialed way down and the characters are given interior dimensions beyond their powers, including a certain emotional fragility.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/thunderbolts-review-marvel-the-new-avengers-1236381303/):\n\n>As with the Guardians of the Galaxy films, what works here is the uneasy tension within a team that comes together out of necessity, rather than any natural sense of affinity.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/thunderbolts-review-marvels-fun-supporting-avengers-1236379893/):\n\n>Fortunately in pure Hollywood fashion these past supporting stars rise to the occasion and get their chance to shine. Chief among them is Pugh, bringing real gravitas to Yelena in a darker portrayal than what she did in Black Widow. Stan finds new ways into Bucky/Winter Soldier now on his 10th go-round with the character, Russell really gets much to do here in a comeback for John Walker, as do Kurylenka and John-Kamen. Harbour, as he did in Black Widow, is here mostly for comic relief, relishing in his over-the-top antics, and newcomer to the franchise Pullman makes the most of a nerd-turned-dangerous-superhero, or antihero as all of them really are.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/thunderbolts-review-marvel-movie-1235119020/) (B-):\n\n>It\u2019s a force strong enough to bond a group of enemies into the world\u2019s greatest team of superheroes, and to malform decent people into indiscriminate murderers. It\u2019s a force strong enough to cohere a string of spandex-clad blockbusters into one of the defining cultural phenomena of the 21st century, and \u2014 just maybe \u2014 a force strong enough to save that series of blockbusters from collapsing under its own weight in the face of certain Doom. Time will tell. The good news for the MCU is that \u201cThunderbolts*\u201d buys them some more of it, and at a much-needed discount.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh/) (80):\n\n>For once, these Marvel movies feel genuinely working class: the headliners have skedaddled, leaving has-beens and day-players the chance to take center stage, in this movie and also in real life. The thought of watching forgotten characters from forgotten movies work through their issues may not dazzle you, but Pugh is, as usual, perfection. Louis-Dreyfus is an excellent villain. Pullman is doing complex work. Schreier\u2019s film makes you care, whether you gave a crap before or not, and at this point in the franchise that\u2019s a big accomplishment.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/thunderbolts-review-marvel-sebastian-stan-florence-pugh-david-harbour) (7/10):\n\n>Thunderbolts* has, like its sort-of-not-really antagonist, both a dark half and a light half. But only one of them is actually pretty great (hint: it\u2019s the one that involves plumbing the depths of the characters\u2019 worst memories).\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/thunderbolts-review-florence-pugh-sebastian-stan-keep-marvel-torch-lit-11723917) (75):\n\n>A lot of what works in the movie does so due to the talent of the performers. There aren't a lot of jokes or killer lines in this, but little bits of business that Pugh and Russell, in particular, make work. Harbour's loud, boorish Russian bear is funny at first, but alas, gets tiresome in a short amount of time.\n\n[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/thunderbolts-review-mcu-florence-pugh-1235319681/) (70):\n\n>The primary goal of this entry is to establish a new team of heroes. The secondary aim is to stop what\u2019s undeniably been a downward spiral. It succeeds in that respect at the very least. Don\u2019t call it a return to form so much as a much-needed, extremely welcome return to a winning formula.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh-b2740716.html) (4/5):\n\n>Thunderbolts* does feel different to what\u2019s come before, not because of those indie credentials, but because it\u2019s the first of its kind to seem genuinely self-aware.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/thunderbolts-review-mcu/) (80):\n\n>Even though the film does at times feel like it's setting up for future projects, it never feels burdened by this, but rather, like we're seeing the natural progression of where these characters' stories should lead. Thunderbolts* is a pleasant surprise in the MCU; it only took a team-up of Marvel\u2019s unlikeliest superheroes to bring it out in them.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1846662/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-review/) (70):\n\n>Provides a spoonful of laugh-out-loud moments of sugar from David Harbour to help make the medicine go down.

Too weak to beat the Scarlet Witch, all he can do is run away and cower at the sight of her, all the while his literal butler Wong remains as the Sorcerer Supreme. He might as well have been some random, generic Master of the Mystic Arts instead of Stephen Goddamn Strange himself.\n\nWanda was just a generic slasher villain, complete 180 turn from her arc in her own show. All she cared about was the kids, I don't think she ever mentioned Vision. She also resolves the movie's conflict and just... defeats herself, with the protagonist having zero to do with it.\n\nChavez, another of the lame teenage sidekick characters which became a recurring trope through all of Phases 4 and 5, was just a plot device.\n\nIt certainly felt undercooked when it comes to the main freaking characters of the film", "My issue was more with that they repeated the same character arc as wandavision.", "I'll agree to disagree with you on that.

The person who'd win in a fight is the person that the scriptwriter wants to win! If I'm writing a story, about The Thing, from the Fantastic Four, and he gets into a big fight with Spider-Man, and millions of people out there say Who Would Win? Well, it depends on who I want to win if I'm writing the script. If I want Spider-Man to win, he'll win. If I want the Thing to win, he'll win.

{"subreddit": "MarvelStudios", "title": "Sam Wilson not having powers is really stupid.", "body": "   I\u2019m not one of those guys that want him back as falcon, but at least he stood out. His only reason for not getting powers is \u201che doesn\u2019t want to be like Steve\u201d \u201che wants to be a relatable every man\u201dwhich doesn\u2019t make sense because anyone can relate to Steve powers or not. There\u2019s no logical reason in universe (films or comics)  It\u2019s not inspiring or endearing like Batman, Deku or other street tiers, it just makes him look stubborn and weak. He\u2019s got tech to \u201ccompensate\u201d but marvel won\u2019t go too far because he\u2019ll be too much like iron man. Most of the tech he gets from Wakanda. Both films and comics have established multiple Safe alternatives to the OG serum. \n    \n    The social commentary of Him being a black Captain America after Isaiah Bradley already makes him stand out a lot from Steve and Bucky. He\u2019s also a therapist for veterans. Not to mention the wings (which often are broken, he just got a new suit in the comics because he got injured.) Not taking the serum especially in the movies case where he\u2019s about to fight a multiversal war just makes him look worse, especially to THAT crowd looking for reasons to hate him. I try to ignore it, but it doesn\u2019t do anything but force comparisons. Steve would\u2019ve held up better against red hulk. Steve would\u2019ve held up better against the random mercenaries in the film. \n\n    The problem is Marvel makes it a point that he refuses to get powers, he CHOOSES to not be better at his job, not that he\u2019s unable to. Batman\u2019s always training, he\u2019s at superhuman levels and backs it up, his whole thing is not having powers but still being one of the best fighters, best ANYTHING in DC. Not to mention Shang Chi, the robins, lady shiva, karate kid (all beating Sam) So many powerful characters that have no power. There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t see many people putting Sam Wilson in VS battles.\n\n    To me it seems like Marvel doesn\u2019t care about Sam Wilson at all. They just gave Sam the mantle of Captain America just to make us happy. Still no big stories, or iconic runs/moments, even from before he was Captain. They\u2019re Firm in not giving him too much so he doesn\u2019t look \u201cbetter\u201d than Steve, even tho that\u2019s up to the opinion of the readers. People still like Peter more than Miles despite him being way cooler on paper, even I do and people have called me Miles morales since I was in middle school. To be Cap you already have to have certain morals and ideals(which sam shares ofc) but they don\u2019t expand on what makes him special as a Superhero. Best comparisons again is all the recent inclusions to Miles Morales Spider-Man or any of the Blue Beetles or green lanterns. They share the name with their predecessor/ coworkers yet they\u2019re all CLEARLY distinct from eachother. Jaime, Miles, or any GL after Alan Scott gained WAY more powers and abilities, yet they all standout among eachother. Rhodey Stand out from Tony stark, even the other Batmen stood out from Bruce. \n\nAll out of love for a character I\u2019ve enjoyed since I was a kid watching superhero squad. He just seems a lil empty. At least back then He has his own name so you could ignore marvel not giving a shit about him. There\u2019s another falcon now so either way he\u2019s cooked. Shit Let ME write a Sam Wilson story at this point lol. \n\nTL:DR Marvel makes it hard to believe in Sams capabilities as cap because they keep pointing out his lack of power without any real compensation. They make it a point to put him in 2nd place, He always gets the scraps. They needa  either give him powers or put him at a \u201csuperhuman\u201d level.", "author": "0kdevv_", "upvotes": 0, "postID": "1kcakw1", "postImage": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kcakw1/sam_wilson_not_having_powers_is_really_stupid/", "postUrl": "/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kcakw1/sam_wilson_not_having_powers_is_really_stupid/", "comments": ["To me the argument that Sam has to take the serum is pretty much the same as asking why didn't Tony just build suits for everyone.\n\nIt would make sense in real life, why not take all the advantages possible.... but it gets boring in a movie/comic sense as everyone is just the same.\n\nThunderbolts lineup already has 3 super serum dudes, Sam doesn't need it.

We follow his transition from Falcon to Captain America in FATWS, when he comes to the conclusion that he's got what it takes to be Captain America.

The Serum should not be treated like a rare thing for somebody to take (it's fine for Walker to take it as it's fits his character but Sam's doesn't need it because well look at his suit, he's like a combo of Tony, Steve, and T'Challa into one person. He doesn't need the serum.)", "I mean stupid yes. But comics have to limit people. Why doesn\u2019t Tony always just his most powerful suit in comics?

You can\u2019t defeat Galactus and Doom with a hand-to-hand combat.", "Did he ever have the serum to make that choice?\n\nAll I can remember is him answering a hypothetical from Zemo, but it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen TFATWS.", "Then that goes for Tony, Natasha, Rhodey, Clint and Yelena, too.  Right?", "I think it's fine if you don't want Sam to have powers, but it also needs to be reflected in his stories. Like Sam should absolutely be getting crushed in one on one hand fights. It makes sense that Steve can beat up an elevator full of guys or beat Batroc one on one in a fistfight. But Sam shouldn't be able to. \n\nWhen a see Sam in a hallway fight with highly trained merchs, I'm rolling my eyes when I see him win. Makes me like the character less.", "Wouldn't be shocked if part of it is to keep it from being uniform.", "Let him talk to birds.  Be comic accurate.", "I can't get into Sam no matter how hard I try but I think it's partially due to the fact that I am not a fan of Anthony Mackie's acting for the most part", ">To me the argument that Sam has to take the serum is pretty much the same as asking why didn't Tony just build suits for everyone.\n\nNot really.  \n\nThe serum permanently changes you and augments your strongest personality traits, for good or evil, which was the point of CA1 and Captain America vs Red Skull.", ">What I like about Sam Wilson is that his self questioning is believable.\n\nNot really, they fumbled it badly.\n\nIt would be believable if Sam didn't take the serum and kept failing.\n\nBut they couldn't handle the risk involved in a movie where Sam can't throw the shield at Mach 5 as a normal human, can't stop a truck because he's a normal human, can't catch a tree being swung by a rage monster because he's a normal human.\n\nSo instead of seeing Sam failing repeatedly, then reaching a crisis point where he has to take the serum at great risk/cost to himself to save others, we get a Sam that can casually do anything (often better than Steve Rogers) and the serum is just pointless chatter that isn't going to do anything for him.\n\nThe character is completely botched at this point.  What's the serum going to do for a normal human who can stop trucks?", "Why doesn\u2019t Tony always just his most powerful suit in comics? - Because they're all situational.

Only a few Avengers are normal humans without abilities that meet or exceed the suits.  The only ones that would benefit from it are Black Widow and Starlord.\n\nWhy does Thor not give everyone access to the powers of himself? - Because that's not how Thor works.\n\nWhy does Black Panther not make vibranium suits for every single avenger? - Because Wakanda is an extremely isolationist society that's spent its entire history hoarding power.\n\nWhy does the government not create an army of super soldiers? - Because the serum permanently augments personality traits, for good or bad, which was the whole point of the first Captain America movie.  The whole point was that they wouldn't get an army of super soldiers, they'd get an army of super villains.\n\nWhy don\u2019t all utilize Pym particles? - Limited resource, very limited usefulness.", "Why don't we just give the Serum to everyone then?

For one thing, we know from \"Loki\" that there was a single sacred timeline. And if it was formed from the universe in which Steve stays with Peggy, then Peggy's husband was always Steve. Secondly, we've already seen a time loop in Ms. Marvel where Kamala ended up in the past to help her grandmother, and it ended up being: the grandmother's stories of her rescue as a child that rescue was always Kamala. Which means that some time travel is already part of the main universe, and others create new alternate realities. \n\nAgain to reiterate, it's possible that this could have had something to do with the formation of the sacred timeline. Or even, if we allow for the fact that time travel creates an alternate universe, then for that universe the given time travel becomes part of it, which means some journeys for the universe are already part of it if it was originally formed by time travel, and other journeys create alternate universes if they have nothing to do with the given universe. \n\nAnd about Steve not trying to change anything, he knew it would end up relatively well, albeit with Tony's death, where's the guarantee that by trying to change things he wouldn't make things worse.

Any changes are just creating new timelines. we see the fallout of this in Loki, where a new timeline was created due to Loki escaping. It's also stated like a dozen times. \"Changing the past does not change the future\"\n\nRe: your Loki point. I think it's best understood that the Sacred Timeline was a collection of similar timelines, not one single timeline. Otherwise the whole show makes essentially 0 sense. They show multiple timelines in that show including one where Loki is Sylvie. The TVA is just making sure none of them veer off too far and lead to the creation of another Kang.\n\nRe: Ms. Marvel. I think the way to take that show and make it noncontradictory to Endgame is just that it's a different form of time travel. It's a more mystical one and using different tech. So perhaps its capable of a different sort of time travel that can create a time loop.", "Pepole fail to realize that simply traveling to the past/future does not cause a branch & thus, a loop can happen.", "They establish that\u2019s not how the quantum realm version of time travel works when Rhodey shares his \u201ckill baby Thanos\u201d plan.", "the thing that no one ever considers is this:\n\nthe sacred timeline that we've always been watching IS the alternate timeline that Cap creates by going back in time and living in the background with Peggy.\n\nthere would've been an original timeline where that didn't happen, and then when he went back that created a split... we've always been watching that split.\n\n  \nthe original timeline has Cap not return to it with Hulk and Sam just arguing until it's pruned. The one where old man Cap gives Sam his shield after living in the background IS the timeline that leads to HWR one day and thus is the one that has always been protected.", "As seen in Loki s2, the \"Sacred Timeline\" is many timelines woven together like a rope. The main similarity between all of them being that none of them have a Kang in them.\n\nAnyway, via the method of Time Travel Steve was using, it would have been impossible for Steve to go back into the maintenance and live there. Anytime you go into the past through the quantum realm, you immediately create a variant timeline as soon as you appear in the past. (The writers did this to side step paradoxes)\n\nIf Steve had a TVA time pad he could have done it, but he didn't. \n\nSteve was not married to Peggy in the main timeline.", "I get the confusion because it really comes down to how that scene was directed. Even the Russo brothers and screenwriters don't agree on what you're asking. \n\nFor it to make sense that Cap is returning to the main timeline in the end scene, it means he would have gone back and lived a life with Peggy in an alternate timeline and then used the Quantum Realm with the suit and Pym particles to return to that very moment with Bruce, Bucky and Sam. This is what the Russo brothers say happened. But they don't have him return to the platform with the suit....they have him sitting on a bench instead. \n\nThis is where the screenwriters don't agree because that little piece invalidates, to a certain extent, the explanation of how he used the Quantum Realm to return to that moment. The writers reject the alternate timeline theory and say Steve was always part of the main timeline, so for that to be true, it means he was always meant to be Peggy's husband. \n\nThis is where it gets messy because you're right, they kinda do a bad job of explaining what really happened. It doesn't really make sense that Steve was Peggy's husband all along in the timeline that we see (think Winter Soldier) cause that opens up a whole other series of unanswered questions. \n\nWith these 2 divergent ideas in mind: \n\n1) one could argue that the timeline we have always seen with Steve is an alternate timeline and not the main timeline where Steve never returns to the platform, which would make sense that he was already sitting on the bench and did not come through the Quantum Realm. Someone else wrote about this in the comments and I think it's a good argument. \n\n2) one could argue that Steve found another way to travel through the Quantum Realm to return to that spot where he knew they would be and quietly sat down on the bench without them noticing. I find it kinda hard to believe he was already sitting there when they set everything up and they didn't question an old man hanging out nearby, especially with Bucky's hypervigilance. I think it's possible he would have found another way back since he would have had access to Hank and Pym particles in the past just by associating with Peggy and her work. He would be instrumental to Hank's work with all the knowledge he has of the future.\n\n4) one could argue that when Steve went back to live a life with Peggy, he didn't do anything significant to change the timeline except live a private, quiet life with Peggy, which means he could remain in the main timeline that we see and patiently wait for everything to go down. This would mean Steve was always her husband, but a different Steve than the one we see in the hospital in Winter Soldier. Gets more confusing here. \n\n3) it was a bad directors choice to have him sitting on the bench and he did in fact travel back through the portal, which doesn't explain how he ended up on the bench without the suit on.\n\nJust traveling back in time does not create a new branch, but changing things significantly like removing the time stones does. Agents of SHIELD does a great job with time travel and FitzSimmons explain it way better than Bruce and Tony. They also bring in many other elements that we don't learn about in the movies. Highly recommend if you've never watched the show!!!\n\nThe fact that people are still arguing about this to this day means your confusion is valid! I believe it's a case of directors choice in leaving out information and hoping that viewers will correctly speculate on what happened. Realistically speaking, we don't really know how long Steve was sitting on that bench or when/where he came from.", "Steve went to live with Peggy on a branched timeline and came back to give Sam the shield after that life.

Either removing an Infinity Stone OR doing something contrary to the sacred timeline's \"script\" causes a branch to form.\n\n\nIf it was always \"in the sacred timeline's script\" for Steve to go back in time to be with Peggy, then there is no contradiction to that \"script\" and a branch would not form.\n\n\nMs. Marvel and Loki both support that time travel loops are possible and do occur. They also both support that going back in time doesn't inherently create a branch.\u00a0\n\n\nSide note: The idea that going back in time inherently causes a branch would make Steve's mission to return the stones impossible. It would also mean that it isn't OUR Sam that would get the shield.\n\n\nBut really at the end of the day, Steve showed back up on the bench and not the platform.

My personal explanation for that is the only explanation we get from that is from the Ancient One who just wants it back for her own reasons.

A lot of the negativity comes from people who either checked out emotionally after Endgame or who expected every project to have that same level of stakes and spectacle. The MCU shifted gears \u2014 it started exploring more character-driven stories, experimenting with genres (WandaVision, Moon Knight, Werewolf by Night), and expanding its universe in ways that don\u2019t always lead straight to a massive crossover event. That change threw some people off.\n\n\nBut here's the thing: the MCU is evolving, and not every phase has to be a nonstop blockbuster parade.

Things *were* good, *now* they're not.\n\n2.  You're using critics reviews to define \"good\", which is fairly pointless.  Critics give good reviews to maintain access, or for activism reasons, critic reviews are useless.  You want audience scores, like Cinemascore.  Critics don't matter, they aren't buying 100,000,000 tickets.  The audience is.\n\n3.  You're trying to carefully frame the discussion to get the answers you want.  Quantumania flopped, The Marvels set industry records in bombing, Eternals underperformed, Wakanda Forever underperformed, Love and Thunder is hated, Brave New World either flopped or bombed depending on whether or not the rumored budget is true.\n\nSecret Invasion is reviled, Ms. Marvel had very low viewership, Echo had very low viewership, X-Men 97 had extremely low viewership, Agatha had middling viewership, the only numbers on Daredevil I can find are below Agatha.\n\nYou need to deal with the number of people watching MCU products, not critic reviews.  Critic reviews don't stop Disney from shelving the MCU, people paying for their products does.\n\n4.  *\"it didn't fall off after Endgame, they just became less and less important to the general public\"* That's exactly what \"falling off\" means.\n\n5.  *so now that they're coming back to they're like Pre-Endgame, Endgame state, the haters will stop complaining*  It's not back to the Endgame state until every movie is in the 700m-1 billion range at the box office.  On the TV side, it needs to compete with the other streamer's flagship titles.  Fallout, a niche video game property, pulled 65 million viewers in 14 days, the MCU hovers around 10 million for an entire run.\n\nIt's a long way to go before the MCU is at a point where one could argue it's fine or back to where it was.", "The fact that people still down Marvel Studios and even Kevin Feige is just insane to me\n\nLord Feige does it again.

No way Home was only hyped due to nostalgia and fanservice. But the movie is nonsensical and many have pointed that, also the only thing that adds to the MCU is the possibility of seeing a more grounded spiderman without the cast of horrible side characters. Then We have Quantumania that is terrible, Eternals that is not terrible, not good, failed at making us love the new characters, and failed to add too much to the MCU, they just feel too detached for the general flow of the shared universe. Captain Marvel they failed because they wanted to shoehorn their new toys selling characters with Maria and Ms Marvel. \n\nThis fase is full of products with stories that nobody cared about, a lot of plots that totally ignored they are in an universe and that it happened things before, they barely evolve characters and universe. Also everyone is a standup commedian now and every movie is the same colouful and full of explossions and fireworks.\n\nIt felt like seeing Marvel studios for some reason trying to shove fanservice and new toys down your throat without any thought on making a good product.

The blip, the consequences of the blip, cosmic and on earth, the avengers dissapearance consequences, the new heroes that arise on that context and new problems. \n\nPeople didn't needed a chinese kung fu master who fights against mithological creatures.

They have to split it with the theaters. \n\n\nIt varies by company, country, and studio, but the general rule of thumb is that the studio receives: \n\n- 25% of the Chinese box office\n\n- 40% of international box office\n\n- 60/55/50% for the first/second/third+ weekends of the domestic box office\n\n\nAgain this is just a general average. Disney, for example, is notorious for playing hard ball and getting higher first-weekend percentages with domestic chains. \n\nSo dp/w:\n\nChina: 60m x .25 = 15m\n\nInt'l: 640m x .4 = 256m\n\nDomestic: \n\n1st weekend: 211m x .6 = 127m\n\n2nd weekend: 100m x .55 = 55m\n\n3rd+ weekend: 325m x .5 = 167.5m\n\n\nTotal is  620.5m in box office receipts going back to the studio, a far cry from the original 1.3b number. \n\nYou have the 200m budget and 160m p/a, that's 260.5 million profit from the box office receipts. Of course the costs were probably a little higher and the percentages were too, and then you have to account for backend deals, merchandising, tax credits, pvod and streaming fees, etc. \n\n\n\nBut no, it wasn't a 900m gamble.", "This was not a gamble in any way shape or form.

Hollywood accounting", "For big budget movies with a sufficiently large US domestic share, you can use 2.5 times the budget to calculate the breakeven point for the studio, so for Deadpool and Wolverine, that should be around 500 million or 600 million if pessimistic.

Anchor Beings, Nexus Beings, The Sacred Timeline, Branching Realities, Incursions, Variants, etc etc. But I really hope they don't do that moving forward. I'd like to see a bit more inter-connectivity between **characters** and have them focus on a core group to drive the main story like they did with the Infinity Saga.

My recommendations if you're looking for something that are largely considered great or something very different are the following, hopefully scratching that itch for what you're looking for:\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy - You already met these characters in Avengers: Infinity War, but it's a very fun intergalactic romp with a completely unique group that has a lot of heart. Probably one of the funniest Marvel movies with an absolutely killer soundtrack.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier - Often considered the gold standard of Marvel movies. If you don't care too much about knowing all the loose threads, you can just jump in, but if you want the backstory, watch Cap 1. Winter Soldier is an all-out espionage thriller that keeps you on your toes and has some excellent action\n\nEternals - This is one of the more recent movies released, and honestly, it was one of the less popular, but it is decidedly not in line with the Marvel formula. It's a century spanning epic introducing a full family of unique characters. Not the bread and butter of the casual Marvel fan, but based on you not vibing with other more quintessential MCU movies, this might do it, who knows?\n\nDaredevil (TV) - A 3 season TV series that just got a continuation called Daredevil: Born Again. Some of the best Marvel has ever been, with a strong street-level war on crime. Has incredible action, compelling characters and drama, and works on all levels even outside of Marvel.\n\nI hope this helps get you a little bit further into this greater universe that has been enjoyed by so many of us, but if none of these hit for you, that's totally fine.

And I STILL don't know why he got out! Don't tell me it was the blip. Disney does not get to just answer every legitimate and important question about the MCU's inconsistencies with \"it was the blip!\" No. How was it the blip? How does somebody who was very publicly and repeatedly disgraced as a cop killer and someone who literally blackmailed the whole FBI get to just waltz out of prison because some judges went missing? It don't make no sense. And apparently he has been out for a while, but Foggy Matt and Karen are just hanging out at a bar and laughing about how good and carefree their lives are?\n\n What show is this? It feels like a bad episode of NCIS, especially with every other line being about bad cops and good cops, and the thin blue line. \ud83e\udd22  karen foggy and Matt should all be freaking out about Fisk getting out, and trying to put him back in jail. But they all seem to have forgotten what was desperately important for the first three seasons of the show. \n\nSo Fisk gets out, and decides he wants to...run for mayor? Wtf? Why? \"So he can control the city\" he already controlled the city! He should be rebuilding his criminal empire. He can buy a politician like most rich people do. Fisk is not a politician. He hates public scrutiny. He is a criminal. More importantly, why would people vote for him? I get it, \"he's supposed to be trump!\" Omg, great. Because that dead horse of a story trope hasn't already been beaten enough. Fisk is literally a criminal mastermind who orchestrated the murder of both cops and journalists. No one would vote for him in real life. One guys in the show says \"he crushed somebody's head? I'd like to see that!\" Wwwwhhhat? Is this what these writers think of regular working people? They're just bloodthirsty savages waiting to find some psychopath to lead them to chaos and destruction? No. Nobody would vote for someone like Wilson Fisk, in any reality, not even the MCU.\n\n\nFoggy dies with no buildup. He is the second most pivotal character in the whole show, and they just kill him without any chance for us to get settled back in, or remember who he is, or have some kind of understanding of the cosmic underpinnings or ramifications of his death, or for Foggy to show what an important part of Matt and Karens lives he was, or any reason or justification why someone just starting the show now would care about foggy,, none of that. He just gets killed because a bad guy wanted revenge. For what? Foggy didn't do anything to bullseye! Matt got bullseye to fight Fisk, but kept preventing him from killing Fisk, which is how bullseye got injured. So he should want revenge against Matt. But he should want it even worse against kingpin, who killed his girl and manipulated him. Also, what happened to his bullseye pupils?\n\nNow Matt is sad, and karens leaving, but we have a brand new cast of characters we pulled straight from an episode of CSI, so you're happy with that, right?\nMatt is questioning being Daredevil AGAIN?! Half the third season he was questioning, then he tells sister Maggie \"I am daredevil, its who I am. Even God couldn't stop it now if he tried\" So we are just throwing out everything out about the og show, except the aesthetic, and the actors?\n\nThe new costume sucks. The og one was perfect. This new one looks completely generic. \n\nThe fight scene in episode 1 with Bullseye was soooo bad. Like, I know people say the fights look good in this show, but I don't see it. The action is muddled at best. They hide it behind bad camera angles, darkness, and strobe lights. In the old show, you felt every punch. In this one, you can barely see half the punches. \n\nI only saw one episode to be fair, but I will not give Disney any more of my viewing time just to see if they do anything to honor one of my favorite shows ever that they've completely ruined now. I don't care if Punisher shows up, they will ruin him like they ruined Daredevil and Fisk. We deserve better than this people! Remember in the 90s and 00s when we could all admit that superhero movies sucked? Why cant we just admit to ourselves that these crooks like Kevin Feige are just swindling us out of our money, are complete sheisters, and not to be trusted? I was honestly going to just skip this because I didn't think they could do it justice, but people said this was different and its better. I do not see it, at all. This is like the Hawkeye treatment for Daredevil. Pointless story, poorly written characters with no clear or compelling motivations, bad fight choreography, worse special effects, and uneven acting. I'm so passed right now, I don't think I will ever watch a Disney marvel show again.

Given that Disney/Marvel and Sony have problems reaching deals to use Spidey in MCU movies, would it be simpler if Marvel simply focused on animated series for Spidey going forward?\n\nSecret Wars is probably gonna involve a sort of \"multiversal reboot\" of the MCU, so everyone is probably gonna have some shake-ups to established backstories anyway. Would it be a deal-breaker for fans if Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man became the new official backstory for the MCU's Spidey, and the main source for new Spidey stories? Obviously this would mean no more live-action Spidey movies in the MCU, and would even mean that any team-up or crossover events would need to be animated... but would this be a small price to pay to stop Marvel having to go cap in hand to Sony every time they want to use him for something, and to stop having to deal with Sony's insistence at constantly trying to turn everything into an advertisement for their non-MCU movies?\n\nThere could still be \"movies\" under this structure; instead of releasing a two-hour movie in cinemas, Marvel could release an animated miniseries of 4 half-hour episodes on D+.

S3** - See explanation for What If...? S2.\n* **Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man S1** - Some characters from this might pop-up in Secret Wars, but it's unlikely.

I wish we could've got like a small explanation for how they know Tiamut is a celestial, and if they understand what that means (that celestials essentially create planets, stars, moons etc) and just their reaction to the fact that they're essentially mining a god who could've created other planets, moons and stars etc.", "I'd add that Tiamat's conciousness joined the unimind. Maybe the knowledge of Adamantium came from there? like they went \"hey, convert me into this, it'll be easier\"", "Because they couldn't keep ignoring that The Eternals happened.", "I have no idea. I had forgotten everything that has happened in the Eternals movie because there was literally nothing about the movie that was worth remembering, and that's just very sad. Even if I do rewatch the Eternals, I am still not going to remember anything. I remember Captain America Brave New World a lot more than this one.", "For lazy plot reasons", "Would have been an interesting way of including Sersi in Brave New World, I'm hoping that her character gets to stick around in the MCU and having her being a calmer bridge between Avengers and Eternals might work.", "Maybe Peter Quill told them. I mean, he is on earth right now.", "Did they ever say Tiamut's name? I only remember them calling it Celestial Island.\n\nThough all it would take is Peter Quill, Sprite, Karun, or Dane Whitman to spill the beans since they all know about Celestials and are on Earth.", "Yeah, given how 9/10 Eternals are either dead, kidnapped, or in space, I think there are only four people on Earth who know Tiamut\u2019s name at the end of \u2018The Eternals\u2019.   \nMaybe Karun published everything he filmed.", "Yea exactly, I mean who else would know better about the Tiamut situation than Sersi herself! Plus would've been nice just see one of the Eternals in general.", "I\u2019m pretty sure Sersi was picked up by another celestial and taken to space at the end Eternals right?", "Yea but it would've been nice if they gave like a throaway line about Peter Quill educating them about Tiamut and Celestials in general", "Didn't they say Tiamut? \ud83e\udd14 Unless I heard wrong, my bad. But it would've been a better and more meaningful connection to Eternals if one of their names was mentioned if not a cameo atleast", "I think Karun's camera was destroyed by Sprite... and speaking of Sprite, she's technically the only Eternal left on earth coz Arishem didn't both to kidnap her since she no longer has powers lol, would've been nice if she had a cameo where she informs them about Tiamut.", "Ah I completely forgot about that... Bring on the \"yea we spoke to the celestials and turns out we're all good here, barely an inconvenience\" exposition line", "He had 3 or 4 cameras that he kept pulling out after the previous one was smashed. The cameras that were broken were pretty much just thrown to the ground to break the lenses so the videos could still be retrieved.", "Oh yea you're right now I remember!"], "category": "new", "linkTitle": "Too Many Requests"}
