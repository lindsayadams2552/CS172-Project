Also the lack of a russian accent, but I guess that\u2019s on Scarlet Johansson who just couldn\u2019t do a decent one so they dropped it.\n\nThere are layers in her personnality and decisions that I hated alot in the past and understood alot more in Endgame.

It absolutely enhances the experience for me in every way by making it unforgettable.\n\nEdit: Based on the replies I\u2019m getting it seems like a lot of people think reactions like the ones in the video above are the norm in US theaters and we\u2019re all just on board with it. So I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that as a pretty big moviegoer honestly I\u2019ve only ever experienced this sort of thing during MCU films, and really just the bigger ones.

I imagine there\u2019d be a point where there\u2019s such a big threat to everyone, and it\u2019s been long enough since Endgame, that Banner breaks out the old Time Travel equipment to get Stark & Cap\u2019s help.

Dc is hit and miss, henry cavill is great, Gal Gadot doesnt have the physique but gets the spirit right. I agree with Flash and aquaman being off. Batflek grows on me, let down by poor scripts.

TWS is all about that, even. So for a third movie to really push the character, you need to make that compass fallible, and have Steve struggle to realize that, and Bucky is literally the perfect catalyst for that: he\u2019s deeply compromised, but Steve believes in him unconditionally. So you have Zemo manipulate that (as he does), you have Steve go into deep denial about it to the point where the Avengers are torn apart, and you end with a realization that he was wrong (a major point that needs to differ from what we got), which in turn might lead him to give up on leading the Avengers (in this scenario, the Accords would be used to beg the question of \u201cis Cap\u2019s judgment enough to keep a super team accountable?\u201d).

Cap nearly throwing everything away for Bucky, when Bucky is a clear danger, could have been used to incredible narrative and thematic purpose; instead, it\u2019s largely an afterthought, and is tossed aside by an ending that just reasserts TWS\u2019 line of \u201cSteve and his moral code are infallible and should always be trusted.\u201d With that mismanagement, you get a film that offers substantially less-interesting themes and redundant character beats.\n\nCivil War has all the pieces for this kind of movie, too, which is why it\u2019s a shame it assembled them so poorly.", "Idk one of the great things about Captain America is that he\u2019s the poster boy for the \u201cAryan race\u201d and marvel uses that image to show him beating the shit out of Nazis and dismantling every ideal they stand for.", "> They need to switch up Captain America next.

With a king's vision, long term plan, with a king's aim for building power, creating a better world and leaving a great legacy. But Everett Ross was the one who saw what he really was, a CIA black-ops whose only role is to sow destruction and chaos, and once they've done that they move onto the next mission, because they don't know how do deal with the aftermath.\n\n\nKillmonger may have thought he was doing something better or more long term, but he's been black ops for so long, that's all he knows. He became a monster, and could only do monstrous things, the ability to dress those actions up in pretty rethoric was just another part of his skillset, it doesn't change his actions - seems he managed to fool himself though. In more cliched terms: he became that which he claims to fight against.\n\n\nThe first thing Everett Ross said about Killmonger, when they first learnt of his existence, gets to the heart of the matter: \"He's not a Wakandan.

He won't be in \"Avengers\" any more and suddenly the profitability of the film will suffer.  The fact is... Sony needs Disney.\n\nNow Disney is saying they want half?  I mean that's an insane amount, and while they do a lot of work, the fact is they are getting a critical character for their series.  Spiderman is still one of the most important Marvel characters out there.  There's easily years that Marvel stayed alive based on that one character, and while getting x-men who are kind of burnt out is good, Spiderman is still key to long term Marvel plans, don't fuck that up Disney...\n\nBut the thing is Renner really doesn't have a place here, he's backing one mega corporation against another mega corporation and that's not a place an artist should be.

We already know his primary motivation -- protect his family (both biological and the Avengers). Ok, cool. Not a lot we could add on to that or modify about it, though, and a character whose primary drive is already well-defined doesn't tend to make for an interesting story.\n\nNow what I *could* see as an engaging Hawkeye story would be his daughter following in his footsteps to become a superhero in the new post-snap world. We'd get to see Hawkeye's mindset shift from \"protect daughter\" to \"give daughter the skills to protect herself\" and maybe work through some of his trust issues on that front. But Hawkeye himself would need to take a back seat for a lot of the film, since his daughter's motivations would necessarily have to be the primary driving force of the plot.

Do we even know what the counter-offers were?  \n\nSony will make money off Spider-Man either way.  Whether or not they would have made more with Disney on-board is speculation at this point.  Say they make only $600 million profit without Disney but retain 100% profit versus making $1 billion with Disney but splitting profits in half.  That means they would make more without Disney, of course now they will have more costs related to financing the movie, etc, but who knows.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much they were making for Spider-Man\u2019s appearance in other MCU movies, but I\u2019m assuming they could say goodbye to that at this point.\n\nThing is, Disney just got done setting up Spider-Manto have a huge role in the MCU going forward.  It\u2019s kind of crazy that they went in trying to negotiate a contract already in place and jeopardizing their future plans for the sake of being greedy.", "Well, back in the day when Tobey Maguire was our golden boy, billion dollar grossing movies were extremely rare. If you adjust their box offices for inflation, they would be far bigger than Far From Home (let alone Homecoming). Dark Knight came after Spider-Man 3 btw, and it's basically the only example we have. Every Spider-Man movie that came afterwards (not including Into the Spider-Verse) were the Andrew Garfield movies which barely had any hype behind them. Far From Home came after 4 movies Tom Holland's version was in and the last two (the most massively successful Avengers movies) set him up as a huge character from now on. He didn't make 1 billion just because it's Marvel Studios, for such a household character I thought it would be even bigger. This applies to Iron Man too, his success was gradually and skillfully built in three prior movies (two of them solo) before Iron Man 3 and it literally came out after The Avengers, obviously the hype would be insane. Honestly, if Sony decides to make a fourth Raimi movie and everyone important from the original cast and crew is on board, it's very likely they're gonna get a second Spider-Man billion grossing movie.\n\nI just wanna say as well I don't think he was denying any responsibility from Sony on this mess, he was calling out that person for only blaming Sony as if Disney/Marvel are holy. Disney is a motherfucking mercenary, they don't give a shit if something is good or not as long as it makes money, they just understand it usually needs to get solid reviews to be profitable. It can be a challenging masterpiece but if it's potencially a financial flop, they're not interested. I really don't like Disney's strategy to make movies and honestly it terrifies me people think it's great they've bought Fox just because of all Marvel proprieties they retained rights to, it means a huge drop in creativity and artistic diversity in movies from now on. As much as I love the MCU, Star Wars, Pixar and many things from Disney's catalog (even some of the live-action remakes), they only care about sequels and potential franchises and they'll milk them as much as they can.

(RDJ didn't make them himself, Boyega says, but he did \u201corchestrate the making of the waffles.\u201d)\n\n> It was just before Star Wars: The Force Awakens opened in theaters. \u201cIt was time for me to sit down with someone who's been through the extremes of Hollywood,\u201d Boyega says, \u201cand to be given some tips as to how to stay stable.\u201d Boyega asked his agent at the time if he could ask Robert Downey Jr.'s agent if Downey wouldn't mind briefly filling Boyega in on how to just, like, be famous correctly. How to not become so overwhelmed by attention that, as RDJ briefly did, you squander your talent and get busted for heroin, rendering yourself unemployable. Boyega was hoping to skip to the part where you maintain a healthy relationship with your own ego and ambition, so that you're able to make fulfilling and lucrative creative decisions, as RDJ currently does. Sure, that's kind of embarrassing to ask about, but how else would you find out?\n\n> Then suddenly, mid-waffle, Orlando Bloom dropped by. Just unannounced, like it was a regular thing. \u201cI'm not used to any of that stuff, hanging out with Iron Man on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Boyega says now. \u201cI was just like, \u2018Bloody hell. Is this how the celebrities do?\u2019\u201d\n\n> It was the best-case scenario for someone seeking a crash course in fame. He's getting advice from one of the most famous actors in the world, someone who, against all odds, has wound up solid and sane, and suddenly a second one shows up. So while Boyega had the opportunity, there was something kind of crazy he wanted to ask these huge celebrities about.\n\n>\u201cWomen. Women, women, women,\u201d Boyega said. But this wasn't some gross thing where a nascent star asks reformed hounds how to assemble a Pussy Posse. It was more gentlemanly than that.

On the other hand, his parents met in Nigeria, immigrated to South London, and brought up three children in a small apartment while making a modest living preaching and aiding the disabled. Boyega knows that's not going to be his life. So, how do you find that kind of partnership when you're famous enough to casually arrange a mentorship with Robert Downey Jr.? Boyega is borderline wistful as he imagines this ideal woman, equally comfortable in Peckham and Hollywood, going through tough times and dancing on red carpets. \u201cIt's nice to survive with your companion by your side. I'm sure it's a good thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I've never experienced it. And people advise you as a celebrity, \u2018Make sure you get someone who doesn't care about your career.\u2019 Mmmm\u2026I disagree,\u201d Boyega told Downey and Bloom.

Shots are worked on until the final minute before a submission must be made, and it simply becomes a matter of getting a stamp of approval by desperate powers that be just to get it out the door.\n\nAlso, looks like in this particular case the lighting wasn't quite right in the first place which is much more difficult to fix in post so that is working against these shots as well.\n\nSource: Former VFX guy.

In the comics, Tony actually dies at one point, but he had so much weird tech in his body to better pilot the suits, it ended up \"rebooting\" his system (it was kind of dumb).

The fact that Tony's suits are often a technical generation ahead of the War Machine armor is not about trust so much as the fact that Tony is inventing the technology of that \"next generation\" *as he goes*. And it's *not* a bad thing that the War Machine armor is a generation behind the Iron Man armor either; a robust technology is a more dependable technology in combat situations. Just sayin'. \n\nAlso, Rhodey, for all his gifts as a warrior, is just that: a warrior. Give him a hammer, he will know all the best uses that hammer can be put to; give Tony Stark a hammer, on the other hand, and he will know all the best things that hammer can be made *into*, for Tony Stark's gift is not that of a warrior, but that of a creative, an inventor.\n\nSo, I disagree - I think there are entirely valid reasons for the War Machine armor to be a generation behind the mainline Iron Man armor that have nothing to do with whether or not Tony \"trusts\" Rhodey or not, the same as with Pepper and the RESCUE suit (a personal favorite, BTW) both of which have specific roles and are therefore VERY specialized equipment.", "Which is weird considering the very first time Tony gets flying around in the suit he literally encounters a scenario where a parachute would be pretty useful.", "Everybody says that but it could also be because...parachutes are a good idea?

His God of Thunder upgrade wasn\u2019t enough to save Heimdall, Loki, and half of the remaining Asgardians. **And this is peak Thor, as he has been constantly battling and in fighting form for 1,500 years, with even some \u201ctraining\u201d against Hulk**. \n\nAdd to that alll of that loss \u2014 Frigga, Odin, Heimdall, Sif + Warriors 3, 1/2 of Asgard \u2014 and it fuels a properly vengeful and formidable God of Thunder already by the beginning of Act III of IW, as he\u2019s able to withstand a freaking star\u2019s concentrated beam. \n\nHe gets literally the most powerful weapons upgrade that any Asgardian (and arguably any entity) can get in Stormbreaker. \n\nSo, by the time Thor launches Stormbreaker at Thanos, he has earned that power to be able to cut through the Infinity Guantlet\u2019s powers and have Thanos nearly dead to rights (but as we all know, that same thirst for vengeance is exactly what allowed The Snap to happen). \n\n**Basically, at least IW Thor earned his literal god-Tier powers through plot, rather than the plot accommodating him with an arbitrary power level without effort or sacrifice.**\n\nAs for Carol, I know Carol hasn\u2019t had much screen time, but she is kind of in between \u201cshe is as powerful as the plot needs her to be\u201d and having legitimately earned her powers. \n\nIn 1995, she finally gets full access to her Space Stone + Power Core capable of Limitless/FTL energy. But clearly, she\u2019s holding back when she finally gets those powers, or she just hasn\u2019t tested her full potential \u2014 which is kind of like Wanda, also created by an Infinity Stone, goes from moving toy blocks to being able to fight off a near fully-powered Thanos while destroying the Mind Stone (of course, this sort of raises the question of how Captain Marvel can withstand a Power Stone blast and Wanda can dual wield her powers to that degree while Quicksilver\u2019s weakness is...bullets). \n\nBack to Carol \u2014 my head canon is that by the time she unlocked her powers in 1995 she was able to withstand a Power Stone blast, but hadn\u2019t had the 25 years of experience with her powers to be able to do what she did in Endgame. \n\n**TLDR \u2014 usually I\u2019d agree with the \u201cplot accommodating the heroes\u201d reason, but here IMO the powers derive from proper plotting. In IW, Thor\u2019s powers and weaponry had gone through a multi-film arc of being built-up to 100%, and Endgame Carol\u2019s Powers were likely that powerful from the start, and she honed the skills to control and use them during 25 years off-world.**\n\nPS \u2014 Endgame Thor was not arbitrarily weakened.

It will be hard for anyone to live up to Hugh's portrayal. The only way I see it happening is if they really make it different, so people don't compare them as much.

Plenty of people see Toby Maguire as the superior Spider-Man, but that hasn't stopped Tom Holland from being amazing in the role and garnering plenty of fans, new and old.\n\nPersonally something I love about comics is seeing different people's interpretations of these characters, and the films allow for an extension of that. Batman has been recast half a dozen times, and everyone has their own version that they prefer, and that's great!

Keep in mind that while RDJ was Iron Man for 11 years, Jackman was Wolverine for 17 years & it\u2019s fair to say they are perhaps on the same level with Jackman getting a slight edge due to sex appeal lol\n\n\nSure they could make Wolverine short, give him the classic costume, a more comic accurate & quality X-Men film, & more; but I just don\u2019t see them topping Hugh. It\u2019s not like Spider-Man. Yes the Raimi films are iconic but I don\u2019t think people will put Tobey on Hugh level. While Garfield is the best actor to play Spider-Man, the quality of the films left people mixed.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because I spent 17 out of my 26 years on Earth with Jackman as Wolverine that I\u2019m a bit nostalgic.

It will be insanely hard to top Hugh. I\u2019d say the ONLY comic book actors to be as iconic & recognizable as Hugh\u2019s Wolverine are Reeve\u2019s Superman, RDJ\u2019s Iron Man, Ledger\u2019s Joker, & Adam West\u2019s Batman.

Sure Jackman made him more popular to the world at large but even if he had never took the role the character Wolverine would still be the most popular X-Men.", "I really like Jackman as an actor and a person, but some of you really treat this all like he was ever going to be a part of the MCU as Wolverine and there was clearly no chance that would ever happen, except in some jokey Deadpool thing. And why? Because Fox/Jackman take on character was nothing remotely like the comics besides some very surface things, like his haircut, having a troubled past he can't fully remember and smoking cigars.\n\nHonestly he did a good performance with the scripts he was given, and came to be known around the world as Wolverine despite not remotely having the physicality for the role.

And everyone thought \u201chey we\u2019ve got licenses to a stable full of similar characters. Let\u2019s trot a few of them out and get our own shared universe going!\u201d  And here\u2019s the thing: it could have worked. It really could have. Despite what the fanboys say, there\u2019s nothing objectively wrong with the DC or Fox source material that makes them unsuitable for a big grand shared universe, something to provide a healthy competition with the MCU. No reason we fans couldn\u2019t have had Pizza AND Burgers to choose from depending on our mood. \n\nBut these other studios got their eyes too set on the prize and didn\u2019t think through what made the MCU successful. They saw the superficial trappings of it and came to the wrong conclusions, it was like the cargo cult of hero movies. They thought if they just put out the trappings of these successful movies they would somehow BE successful movies, without recognizing what else goes into that. They saw gritty realism in place of goofy colorful spandex. They saw movies with big all star casts. They saw dramatic battles with high stakes that aren\u2019t afraid to include the deaths of major characters. They saw humorous quips to lighten the mood occasionally. And all of those things were true!  I don\u2019t mean to say a good shared hero universe shouldn\u2019t have those things, because they really can contribute to the movies. \n\nBut they missed the innards that make those little things worth including. They missed the long game. They missed the part where you should be dropping little plot investments you don\u2019t intend to cash in until years later. Having Loki using multiple infinity stones in 2010 when they wouldn\u2019t be assembled for nearly a decade is a perfect example. These other studios missed that the movies can\u2019t just be a vessel for team ups, you should be able to watch most of them in isolation and have a good viewing experience, with occasional exceptions like a Endgame that are like 5-10% of the movie slate as pure payoff. Everything else should be setup. You could watch Iron Man, or Thor Ragnarok, or Winter Solider with little or no Marvel experience and still come away thinking \u201chey that was a good movie.\u201d  That\u2019s why Man of Steel was a better movie than Batman v Superman: it was comfortable with standing alone as a Superman story. The directors cut of BvS fixed a lot of issues, but even that couldn\u2019t erase the context of the movie: a studio-pushed, accelerated attempt to kickstart the shared universe. It came too soon. We should at least have gotten a Batman, Flash, and maybe Wonder Woman movie before they started throwing them together in major ways. \n\nFox/X-Men made a similar mistake: all the mainline movies were huge team-up movies with world-ending stakes. There were no individual character study movies until the disastrous Wolverine Origins movie and even then he had a huge team of mutants around. The later follow up \u201cThe Wolverine\u201d was a good example of what to do, but it happened after the universe had already been bloated and bogged down. Days of Future Past was saved purely by being one of the best written comic book movies of all time, and I think they should have called it quits right there on a high note. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad that the only way the X-Men material will be successful will be under the MCU umbrella, because I think some healthy competition is good....but if this is what it takes, then OK I guess.

Superman dying in BvS had absolutely zero impact because they rushed to it entirely too quickly and had a complete lack of cohesive story and character development to get to that point. \n\nThe DC universe was haphazardly thrown together in a mad dash to get to the team-up movie, leaving audiences with no time to let the characters grow on them. Sure, these are very established comic book icons, but you have to treat them like the audience is seeing them for the first time since it's about how you're bringing that character to life, not just skipping ahead to where you want to start, hoping the audience came to the show completely vested in what you're selling.\n\nMCU worked because they took their time and built the world intricately and brought audiences along for the ride. People cared when Tony died because they felt like they had been there for his triumphs and defeats all along the way. They knew who he was as a person and identified with him on some level.

The MCU is great but we don\u2019t need a carbon copy with different heroes. There are times when I think they should take characters in that direction but I think grit is needed especially for characters like Batman and Superman. The sad thing is some of their flops should have been great movies.

The DCEU wanted it's cake after only eating part of dinner (where as the MCU had an appetizer, two mains with drink pairings, and dessert). Fox was just afraid to lean into the weird shit or the political shit. \n\nSure, X-Men vs Brotherhood of evil is all fine and fantastic, as is X-Men standing up to the government, but that's not where the X-Men become brilliant. God Loves Man Kills, for instance, tears down hate in religion hard, but that's not something that would really fly with the American Right Wing being what it is. The Dark Phoenix saga involves cosmic space beings, aliens, and a bit of weird existentialism. Sure they touched on that in the newest Dark Phoenix movie, but they kept it mundane and grounded.\n\nThe FoX-Men movies were kind of a product of their time and kept their tone throughout all the movies. They were being made when superhero movies were trying to be grounded and kind of ashamed of their source material. Even by the end, they didn't embrace the weirdness and the camp like the MCU does, or Shazam does.\n\nBut that's **my** take as someone who has been reading X-Men since 93. My point of view might come from a different place than yours does. :)", "Stewart has the opposite thing going on.

And they could've intro'd smaller characters like Cyborg or Static Shock a little more naturally. It's a great time now because Marvel just climaxed and has to kind of reset. But WB made the mistake of trying to cash in and directly compete with MCU rather than taking the time to plan and see if MCU has staying power.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm suggesting that WB wait a decade on it.

Just keep them separate, drop the occasional one liner that hints at the existence or activities of the others, maybe do some after-credit stingers. Then after 5-7 years of that you can have your payoff, maybe Darkseid or Braniac, or even take a risk at campiness and try out the Legion of Doom/Injustice League. \n\nI think Shazam was a good step in the right direction if they want to keep trying at the shared universe.

John Wick is a prime example of that. Aside from the excellent technical aspects of the film, they spent time giving the audience a way to connect emotionally with John. The story itself was a pretty simplistic revenge story, but they did enough world building around it and the characters within it, that it felt rich and drew the viewer into it. \n\nThat point alone is something DCEU writers should have considered over the complicated jumbled mess they delivered with MoS, BvS and Justice League. If they had been more willing to draw out the stories to make room for their characters to grow, they could have easily gotten 2 movies worth of content out of MoS plotlines, 3 out of BvS and at least 2 more out of JL, not counting all of the independent character movies you mentioned.

Both Jean and Paul are also playwrights.\n\nAnd apparently Ins Choi who wrote the original play had 1 foot out the door for a while and he was nowhere to be seen while the writers room was not representative at all of the people on the show.

With that territory, came the unwanted ability of being a bully magnet, and like most shy little weirdos, I couldn't figure out how to be happy. \nThere aren't a lot of outlets for an unhappy kid to latch on to that'll help make them feel better about being different. There was mostly just silence, and telling adults that you were ok, and when the world around you thinks it's purpose is to beat into you that you're wrong for being a shy little weirdo, that silence, is the only thing you have to look forward to.\n\nYou can't tell you're having a life changing experience in the moment, because nothing actually changes that you can immediately recognize. The bullies are still shaking you down, you're still not allowed to have control of the television remote, and you still spend most of your day wishing you could just get back to silence. With age, comes the tragedies, the victories, and general life experience that teach you that your life changed 31 years ago, with a simple spider bite. \n\nStan Lee's legacy can't be summed up by any one thing. He was a writer, that's one. A writer who slowly climbed a pretty short ladder in a very disrespected field. He slogged through writing backup stories, unhappily, until his wife, Joan, convinced him to write just one more story, a story that would be the last in a canceled book. A story that, most likely, wouldn't be read by many. She believed in him, and without realizing, Stan's life would change forever. With \"Amazing Fantasy #15\", he would change American mythology forever.\n\nHe was humble. That's another one. It'd be understandable for a man who contributed so much to pop-culture, to become kind of a jerk. Stan Lee loved his fans. He worked so hard to welcome them into his smile since 1962. He was always ready with a joke and words of encouragement for anyone within earshot. \n\nHe was respectful. Stan's Soapbox was the definitive column for millions of shy little weirdos around the world. He always seemed honored to hear that so many people loved what he lived to do.\n\nHe was a storyteller. \n\nHe was America's Grandpa.\n\nWhen I think of Stan Lee's Legacy, the loudest thought in my head was he believed in us. He knew we were special, no matter how many people told us we never would be. He gave me a hero that looked, sounded, and felt just like me. Like you. Like all of us. By making Peter Parker all of us, he told us that it was ok to be a shy little weirdo that screws up, that falls down. We would be ok, as long as we never gave up. Stan was Peter, just like we were Peter. \n\nCreativity is so, so hard. And thankless, and rarely worth the effort. Creativity is full of second guessing yourself, discouragement, and heartache. It's too easy to always want desperately to quit. Stan Lee's most important legacy, to me, will always be the hope he gave me when he showed me life can change with something as simple as a spider bite. We're going to fall, we're going to cry, and scream, and hurt. But we can't give up.\n\nStan Lee believed in you his entire career.

When the star wars prequels came out my brother and I were pretty young. When attack of the clones came out my brother was 7. My brother *adored* Mace Windu. The only character he wanted to dress up as for Halloween that year was Mace Windu, played by Samuel L. Jackson. This caused a bit of an issue because my brother is white as snow and bleach blond. So what's the right choice for him playing his favourite character: go out as a white kid with blond hair and effectively whitewash Mace Windu, retaining only the purple lightsaber and essentially nothing else about his appearance; or let him wear black makeup and colour his hair dark to make it look (unconvincingly) like he was dark skinned and bald? Well my parents went for option 3 and said he just couldn't be Mace Windu and instead he got to be Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nI think this is overall bad for kids and acceptance. It made Mace Windu an \"other\" for being black and my brother couldn't be him because there wasn't a solution that wasn't offensive in some way. My brother was crestfallen and didn't really care to be Obi-Wan, all he wanted to be Mace Windu and he wasn't allowed, which left a sore spot in his mind for years.

Strange wanted a bargain with Thanos, Stark's life for the stone. I agree with your first point, Thanos gets to Earth and completes the gauntlet no matter what. The snap *will* happen.

You made an assumption that a closing portal must be infinitely strong and the writers said 'no'. That's all there is to it. Same with the plot idea of Ant-Man expanding inside Thanos and just assuming Ant-Man's growth is absolute and will overpower anything that is surrounding him.\n\nAlso, I dunno how you think Vision cutting Thanos destroys what I'm saying, you might as well tell me that Stormbreaker embedding into his chest destroys the argument that you couldn't kill Thanos with a kitchen knife.

But, he's also a father and a husband, which is such a soft and loving side to a dark and stoic character. Also, in some ways, I feel like he's weak; he doesn't have the guarantee of physical or even mental strength that most of the other characters do (aside maybe from Stark or Banner's fragile psyches). That human weakness makes Hawkeye feel nearly *real*. I always am a little unsure when I'm watching him, making him the most interesting to me. \n\nAlso, I was a HUGE fan of Renner way before his Marvel appearances.

But as captain America his role will change dramatically. He\u2019s going to have to get his hands dirty more. Bucky could take that role, but I don\u2019t know how it will play out.", "Exactly, which is why he's never going to be \"captain america\".

Wait til you find out about Jane Foster Thor.", "Yeah, when people say Captain America, Steve is the one will come to their mind, and that's how it would be for a long time. If he had a more unique new name, it could still carry the same meaning, but give him a name that is synonymous with him instead of someone else. I don't think that will happen and that's fine, but honestly think that could be better for him.", "You are just reading into my comments way to much. I understand that mantles are passed down often in the comics. But in my mind, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers is Captain America. RDJ as Tony Stark is Iron Man. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Anybody taking on those roles will not feel right to me because that is who the character is in my brain. Whether it is just an actor change or it is a passing of the torch in universe, it would be hard for me to see the next person as that character. That is the entire reason for everything I am saying.\n\nIt is probably in part because I was never as comic reader, so the whole mantle passing thing is not as familiar to me. It definitely is not about race in this situation. I think Sam is a great character who is a great fit to fill Steve's shoes. It is just hard to think of him as Captain America because he isn't Steve Rogers and he isn't Chris Evans. It would be the same thing if Bucky got the shield. In time, I will probably get more used to it, but if you say Captain America, I'm going to think of Steve Rogers, and I don't think that will change any time soon.", "You're right.

And I could be wrong, but I'm fairly confident that his strength is considered above human capability.", "I'm not positive as I haven't read many comics, but it wouldn't surprise me. Peak human means he's the perfect balance of strength and dexterity which would make him an extremely formidable fighter.", "Not a single time since the serum. Had to think about it.", "The fight with Leaper at the start of Civil War I guess? Doesn't take a lot out of him tbf but he definitely breaks a sweat.", "I know that's why I said he just pushed harder. Hulk *won* the strength contest but spidey pushed him back initially.", "But during Civil War, Peter has no idea how to use the suit to its potential. He does that in Homecoming, so in CW it was purely his skill with almost no input from the suit.", "Yeah, it was Scorpion. I don\u2019t think the punch would have the same effect on The Lizard", "He took out the Fantastic Four solo.", "I believe those buildings had been evacuated.", "I'm surprised that this is a real discussion. Cap being super strong wasnt his main defining trait.\n\nSam has shown that he can fight. He'll have to be more creative in ways that Steve never did, but being Captain America was about way more than brute force.", "If there was just a movie, or say a mini series to find out how it would play out. \n\nCould be called falcon and winter soldier but that would be like the least imaginative title I could think of.", "No it\u2019s the mantle that was passed down to Sam by captain America", "I'm already aware of that, and feel the same way. Giving her mjolnir doesn't make her Thor in my eyes.\n\nI havent read the comics regarding it though, but she DEFINITELY was not worthy of mjolnir so far, so im interested to see if/how that plays out in the mcu.", ">You are just reading into my comments way to much.\n\nI don't think so. I just want to poke holes here and to get you (and others) to reflect. This kind of situation is very much that passive racism that just permeates one's existence in the US. \n\nI am very guilty of this myself. It was a discussion about hair usage that finally \"clicked\" for me. The first part was shaving in the military, sure clean shaven has it's importance and can ostensibly make sense as a requirement for that reason. But what it does is creates a major problem for black soldiers. There is a legit reason that so many black men have beards, and that's because the curliness of the hair causes a stupid amount of ingrown hairs. The bumps are awful, noticeable, and painful.\n\nI think you did a good job of reflecting. That reasoning is a lot more specific than just \"it feels weird,\" which is how people tend say \"I don't want a black Captain America\" without saying it.\n\nHonestly, the Actor as Alter-Ego as Super Hero link and deep connection was not something I really considered here. I would quibble with those examples though; Logan is \"The Wolverine\" and there's nothing really for him to \"pass down,\" right? It's not like \"The Wolverine\" is a symbol of anything meaningful, it's not like he's an icon that people look up to, and with the mutants, generally their ability is fundamentally tied to their name. It's less a \"mantle\" and more a nickname.\n\nIron Man could be a mantle, but even then, with the movies, we have the inextricability of RDJ's line \"I am Iron Man.\" Plus you already have him building suits for others and giving them other names. \n\nBut... Captain America was supposed to be an idea, right? He was your All-American Every-Man With Good Morals who was given the opportunity to be a **Hero**. While you might see something essential about the person Steve Rogers being Captain America, I view Steve Rogers as more the embodiment of the ideal and with that in mind, I don't see why Sam Wilson isn't just as great a man behind the mask as Steve Rogers.\n\n\nReally though, please do not really take this as me trying to call you a bad person or anything like that. It just felt like an opportunity to engage with some implicit biases.\n\nETA: I def was pretty harsh in my initial comment, because I just saw that entire argument played out when Sam took over the shield in the comics, and I had a bit of a flash-back."], "category": "top"}

It instantly ties into the greater MCU world and other properties\n- For a MCU movie, the first 2 acts were pretty isolated (the vault and desert).

The direction, script and music were all on point. The action was satisfying and the emotions were engaging and it tackles timely social issues. I however felt that this isn't really a movie for first time mcu fans, because as captivating as some of the thunderbolts' stories are, I just wish we could've seen more of these scenes given that the ones shown in the void were really done well.

Now gives a sense of connectivity that even if it\u2019s at that level, does do the trick.\n\nSentry\u2019s suit dropped a lot of laughter at the beginning in the theatre but kinda accepted it while mid fight.\n\nWish Bucky had its own fully centered project, but Yelena and Bob stole the show.", "I enjoyed it! For me it was a solid 7/10! Can sneak up to a 7.5!\n\nIt i indeed a breath of fresh air in the MCU, and the direct setup for the next movie gave me \"good ol' MCU vibes\"!\n\nI will say this. I do think the movie and the plot was predictable. No big surprise twists in my opinion. But unlike other MCU movies with a predictable plot, it was well-written and well-executed. And yet, while the plot was predictable, it sticks the landing. And it never went astray from the plot either. It was one smooth line from start to finish, with perfect pacing.\n\nThe scene where Bucky is going after them, was my first moment of feeling the MCU is back. That scene, for some reason, stood out for me, gave me goosebumps and made me think \"we are so back!\"\n\nClearly, Yelena and Bob are the main characters. And they execute it so well. The dynamic between the 2 of them, and also between them and the rest of the team for that matter, is great. What I slightly missed though, was a trip into the void, or into the shadows, with Red Guardian, Bucky and Ghost as well. We only have that brief moment there with Yelena and Walker. They could easily have added 10-15 minutes extra there, without it hurting the movie.\n\nNow, I did mention the plot was predictable without surprises. Yet, with that said, there was a bit of a surprising jump scare moment for me, in the scene where Yelena find Bob in the void. That took me by surprise.\n\nThe cherry on top of the cake was the end credit scene. That was hype. At first I found the whole \"Cap does not approve (of them being the Avengers), and he will form his own team\" a bit lame. Especially given his relation with Bucky. They could just join forces. But after thinking about it, it makes sense that Cap, with his moral and ethics, would not approve of them being the Avengers, sort of formed by a corrupt Valentina, also even though his friend is part of the team.", "Ghost/Ava Starr clutch moments:\n\n-Opening the doors on that locked down facility so they don\u2019t get cremated.\n\n-Stealing a truck in order for them to escape Valentina and her henchmen.\n\n-Saved Bucky\u2019s arm.\n\n-Saving a civilian from that helicopter crash.\n\n-Cutting the cloth that\u2019s choking Bob & Yelena.\n\n-Killed Taskmaster.", "The return of Buckys knife flip makes it a solid 9/10", "Awesome film!

Not completely action packed but the banter between the team members was fun.", "Overall I really liked this movie and a massive step in the right direction for the MCU. It captured my attention right away.\n\n\nIt was funny, it was sad, it was engaging. One of the only MCU movies to move me emotionally, I almost teared up when Yelena started crying during her speech. Sentry's whole thing was endearing and I liked seeing how his story develop.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Yelena and Sentry were the stand-outs, Walker surprised me a lot and I was much more engaged with him than in \"Falcon and the Winter Soldier\". I can't even remember if he was like this in that but I loved it.\u00a0\n\n\nI had some disappointments:\u00a0\n- I wish we got to see the others confront their past before meeting up with Yelena. They could've skipped Bucky, but it would've been nice to see Red Guardian, John Walker, and Ghost overcome their individual traumas.\u00a0\n- Perhaps the inverse of Walker, Ghost didn't do as much as I was hoping. While she did help the team in several BIG ways, I didn't FEEL like I got to know her as much as the rest. What makes her a loser, why is she working with Val, etc. A shame as I came in hoping to see her fleshed out only to feel like I knew her the least out of everyone. It makes me wish the movie was 10-15 minutes longer just to give her and the others a bit more.\n- Ending felt a tad rushed/anticlimactic. I'm a little unsure how Val's reveal would've prevented her impeachment.\n\n\nMy criticisms do little to hinder my enjoyment, I'd give it a 7.5/10.", "Just saw it. Love it. Best MCU movie for a while. I will see if F4 can match up to it.\n\nThe script is great .. actually means something rather than just have another world-ending CGI horde to fight.

We are so lucky to live in a time when Florence Pugh can headline a $200 million dollar summer blockbuster.\n\n _Super_ by the numbers plot and beats until it goes places I didn\u2019t expect for this movie, and their take on doing \u2018evil superman\u2019 so late to the general audience after The Boys and Invincible was refreshing. Wasn\u2019t too jazzed about Sentry being Sentry in name only, but their original take on The Void was excellent, and I\u2019m hoping we see it again.\n\nAbsolutely surreal to end this movie with the Avengers score and semi-committing to the name with \u201cThe New Avengers will return.\u201d Even more surreal they\u2019re all suited up and hanging out in Avengers Tower and monitoring space activity.

I think one of my favorite new Characters introduce after Endgame. His story made sense his Acting was great and his Character worked, but they only bring up he killed that Terrorist once like it was a bad thing. John just says \"define innocent\" and they move on. Instead of \"No, he was holding me down while that Ginger Bitch was gonna stab me in the Heart and my best friend gave his life to protect me. Then that Terrorist tried to escape into a crowd of innocent people and threw a concrete Water Fountain at me, so I did literally what I was sent their to do\" That really pissed me off, but other than that yeah really good movie had a lot of fun.", "Taskmaster deserved better. Almost pointless and insulting to even include her in the film only to kill her off so quickly and unceremoniously.\n\nApart from that, fucking fantastic and I\u2019m very excited for the next two years and beyond.", "I like how they still maintained the ambiguity with Walker and how much he is worthy of being Captain America. I mean, sure, dude is still an asshole and isn\u2019t really worthy of getting into Steve Roger's shoes. But they also show that his biggest regret in his entire life is neglecting his family after his fall from grace. Even after all the shitty things he knows he did in the military, that is the thing he is most regretful about. He really is the perfect soldier and maybe under different circumstances, he could have been a good man too, considering he has some decent core values.\n\n\nI'm a little disappointed with how the final conflict is resolved. Sure, the movie definitely build upto it with all the characters struggling with their actions and life choices, especially yelena getting a complete arc around that. It is a satisfying ending. But I was hoping the team would get their lick back after getting destroyed by the sentry during their first attempt. The group's entry exit shots in the elevator made it seem like they could take him down if they came up with a plan instead of fighting him head-on. After all, they do have ghost with phasing powers, which is one the biggest hax ability a superhero can have.\n\nThey have great chemistry, but imo they didn't get a definitive \"they are a team now\" moment. The civilians' protection scene doesn't count. With their powers, they could have done what they did even if they were not a team and ghost as a character is entirely replaceable if not for her convenient power which is pretty useful in the first act.\n\nMaybe they could have helped each other when they are trying get deeper into the void to finally get to the place where bob is, which could fit into overall themes of fighting loneliness. They did do a version of it when Yelena alone was struggling with Bob's psyche fighting back and rest of the team coming to help. But learning about each other's trauma and actually helping each other get out of it would have strengthened their bonds immensely.\n\n\nAlso, does sentry have those psychic powers in comics, too, or did the writers give him those powers in the movie for the story they want to tell. I like the implication that the entire population of New York also went through that \"reliving your worst trauma\" moment while they were sucked into the void.", "They really hammered home that these were all super soldiers haha. John\u2019s leap and kick on Yelena were insane, especially that jump. \n\nGhost getting sent flying by Taskmaster* was crazy.", "So, the post credit scene basically reveals that fantastic four will lose in their movie, right?", "I liked how ridiculous they made sentry look, and then really enjoyed it when he turned into Vantablack Sentry", "the middle fight scene when the Sentry is \u201crevealed\u201d is the first time that superpowers actually feel powerful. they nailed the building terror as everyone\u2019s attacks became more futile and Bobs moves became more intense (melting the gun?? the knife shattering??). awesome awesome awesome moment maybe one of my favorites in any MCU movie. loved the whole thing.", "I hate to go off topic but damn going to the movies is freaking expensive!", "Was pleasantly surprised how I enjoyed this movie and was laughing my arse off how the movie ended.

The scene where everyone jumped into action to save people after the crane fell was *great* - it reminded me of the first *Avengers*. I was worried that I might find Red Guardian annoying, but he bought much needed levity when the film needed it. Bob was a great character too.\n\nI wish that there was more meat to Ghost\u2019s role, though - like catching up with how life has been since *Ant-Man and the Wasp*. Her role on the roster could have been replaced with anyone, to be honest.\n\nThe writing felt jumbled. I wish there had actually been a proper resolution to the Valentina impeachment storyline, and Bucky trying to convince her aide to testify against her. It could be argued that Yelena now having power over Val is a worse ending for her, but I think the narrative needed a bit more of a meaty resolution - like, maybe her aid interrupting the press conference to reveal the truth. There was also that line about Bucky only being Senator for less than half a term - was that just a threat? Because otherwise, it doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAn argument can also be made that the film could have committed more to the psychological thriller angle and just gone for an R-rating - to be honest, I\u2019m surprised that the film wasn\u2019t a 15 here in the UK.\n\nIt was funny how much the film just disrespected Taskmaster. Killing her in like the first 10 minutes or so, and not even to showcase The Void or anything - just popped in the head by Ghost.\n\nThe *Fantastic Four* themed IMAX intro was a cute touch.

Heavily flawed man but still tries to do his best on the field and when it comes down to it, he will save people.\n\nI feel like there was around 10 minutes missing around the time where Yelena talks to Bob, and the others deciding to go after them or something. Like, the team would've had to fight their way through the nightmare rooms individually first right?

Actually believing others do love you and trusting in that. The biggest takeaway from the film. This movie has heart, and it\u2019s actually genuine. \n\nThe only blemish I\u2019d say the movie has?

I had good hopes going in, but had some caution. I worried Marvel was going for their own Suicide Squad with a \u201cbad people gone good\u201d setup, which, to me, would be tricky, since most of these characters were never true villains to begin with. Maybe Walker nears that line, but even he was mostly just misguided with some major flaws and errors in TFATWS.\n\nThankfully, the movie does none of that. They\u2019re just a bunch of misfits who cross paths by chance, and it actually works pretty well. The story has plenty of depth and handles mental health in a very classy way that still fits within the MCU. They also dive into character development, which is something I really missed in recent MCU movies (movies, specifically). Yes, the movie is slow at times, but it helped connecting with the characters, which I really appreciated.\n\nThe action is solid. I was hoping for more grounded choreography like in TWS, but I\u2019ve accepted that\u2019s probably a thing of the past. Still, what we got worked well enough.\n\nYelena and Val were definite standouts for me, and I thought Sentry was handled perfectly. It felt like a great comic-to-screen interpretation.\n\nTwo gripes:\n\n1. Taskmaster had a good opening, with an actual line, that hinted at a bigger presence or some form of redemption/justification, but then... nope.\n2. Don't know if this is a hot take, but I'm not a fan of Red Guardian\u2019s portrayal. Wasn't in Black Widow to begin with and they extended it in this movie. The goofy dad shtick felt off and clashed with the rest of the movie\u2019s more serious tone. I get that his angle within the mental health theme is an inferiority complex, combined with family trauma, but I think there are better, more subtle(?) ways to handle those aspects. I love Harbour, but it just doesn't land for me.\n\nAll in all, I absolutely had a blast with this movie, and I finally hit a point where I'm excited again for what Marvel brings next!\n\nBonus point: they actually save common civilians!

Even if they're not your friends or family, it can be a random group of people with similar problems that can help you feel understood. Thunderbolts weren't a superhero team, they were a group therapy meeting. And it felt so honest, like it's not a shoehorned obligatory moral. I cried, I felt understood, I went home and hugged my partner and talked about my past. Not for the first time, but it's great to let your emotions out every time you feel the need to talk and to feel that someone's listening and you never have to be alone with your mind.

You can give RDJ $80M but can't match renner's season 1 salary? Whatever, Disney.", "So disheartened to hear this. I understand Disney is trying to lower the cost of the D+ productions...but they really missed an opportunity here. \n\nJeremy is widely lovely, Clint even more so and the first season was generally well received.\n\nThe whole incident meant that the show would have received an incredible amount of extra publicity and would have attracted interest beyond the Marvel aficionados.", "Good on him.

Kate Bishop is our Hawkeye and the older fella gets to retire to hang out with his wife and kids.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019d need to work several years to reach that value, let alone getting to it in 8 months.\n\nAnd HONESTLY, this isn\u2019t exactly Green Arrow.

It's packed. \n\nSo yeah, I can buy that Disney is trying to screw these actors out of a payday. Marvel to them isn't for the fans or to tell a story. It is a commodity and they aren't content with making a profit off of it.

If their thinking was \u2018Half the money for half as much of an appearance than season 1\u2019, I say they shoulda just paid Jeremy the full money anyway. With how much money they are throwing around for reshoots, re-doing entire shows and Robert Downey Jr. \u2014 it\u2019s not like Marvel Studios are strapped for cash.

To me, if his screen time would be less anyway hence less pay, but his title placing in the credits would be expensive, I think the budget guys set the 50%, not the casting or screenwriters or XO's or PR people.

No \"Infinity Saga,\" no Thanos teases that paid off a decade later\u2014just Tony Stark, a bold casting choice in Robert Downey Jr., and a superhero movie that wasn\u2019t trying to copy what had come before.

Nick Fury talking about the \"Avenger Initiative\" might seem iconic now, but in that moment, was it exciting? Confusing? Easy to brush off?\n\nAlso, how did audiences respond to the tone of Iron Man? The mix of humor, action, and character drama is pretty standard now in the MCU, but back then it must have felt fresh\u2014maybe even risky. And how did people view RDJ's performance at the time, considering his career up to that point?\n\nIf you were a comic reader going in, did it meet your expectations?

Despite being a lifelong superhero fan, I wasn't super excited. I knew about Iron Man from the 90s animated series and thought he was a cool enough character, but it wasn't like he was Batman or anything. I remembering thinking about how they're making C-level characters into movies now.\n\nAnyway, I thought the movie was quite enjoyable. Credits rolled and I think I heard someone say \"Hang on, there's something after the credits\" so I stayed put. Post-credits used to just be a blooper reel or some joke. Nothing important, but I was for whatever it was.\n\nMan, when I heard Sam Jackson's voice, my heart started to race. First of all, it was Samuel L. Jackson! Second, when I saw him in the eye patch, I knew he was Nick Fury, which was awesome. So far, this post-credits scene was pretty cool with a Nick Fury cameo. But when he mentioned, the Avengers Initiative, I think my brain short-circuited. Like I couldn't comprehend that I had just heard that. \"An Avengers movie? No way. They can't do that. Can they? It's just a tease that will be forgotten in Iron Man 2\" The idea of team-up movies had been teased for years but they never happened. The closest we ever got was Bruce Wayne mentioning Metropolis in Batman Forever. But this? This could be real. I was absolutely speechless but still in disbelief. It was only the next day that I heard Marvel was actually going to do it and that Tony would appear in The Incredible Hulk.\n\nSo in short, the experience quickly went from 'just another superhero movie' to \"Ok, I'm having a good time\" to mind blowing.", "Soph in college.

People laughed people cheered. \n\nI was really looking forward to the incredible hulk movie that was coming out after seeing this movie. \n\nIron Man was a memorable movie, so much so that I was interested in seeing sequel and Thor and the rest of em.. dont think ive missed a marvel movie on release ever.", "I turned to my wife after it was over and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe they did it.\u201d", "you have to put yourself in that time period.  Spiderman 3 and Xmen 3 had come out and really didnt live up to the hype.  Superman returns wasn't all that.  FF, daredevil were pretty cheesy.  the Ang Lee Hulk wasn't that great either.  though we did have a sleeper in batman begins, it sort of flew under the radar.  Comic movies weren't at their high point.  All the goodwill that was created with Spiderman 1/2 and Xmen 1/2 had gone.\n\nBut then 2008 hit, and it wasn't only Iron Man...but also the Dark Knight and the incredible hulk.  Dark Knight was definitely the movie of the 3 that got most of the initial hype.  its batman and the Joker and there had been so much talk about Ledgers Joker and what he put into the role..deservingly so.  Iron man at this point was just a b level marvel comic figure no one wanted to license the rights too...and hulk, people weren't to sure about given the last hulk movie.  So no one really predicted Iron Man was going to be as good or as big as it got.  Especially coming from Jon Favreau who at the time was known cause of swingers, really didnt have big budget blockbuster experience.  Shit even Robert Downey Jr wasn't the name he is now.  But then Iron man came out...and it was freaking great.  It blew up in the theaters.  They pulled the whole Samuel L jackson thing at the end....and then the whole avengers thing got solidified a month later as downey showed up in Hulk.  It didn't take long for people to realize what a big deal Iron Man was and this was beginning of something big.  My wildest dreams couldn't imagine how far they'd go down the marvel rabbit hole though.  i remember thinking...wow an avengers movie with multiple hero's?  Unheard of!  The full breadth of what marvel was about to do though i dont think really occured too many, until the end of avengers 1 when we saw Thanos face......and even then people were skeptical.....", "It was a huge payoff for me.

Then, the idea of comic book characters (teased) interacting on screen and crossing over was insane. But I had no idea at the time what was in the eventual pipeline. I was so excited just for the prospect of two characters interacting. Never in my wildest imagination did I think it would culminate to something like Endgame.", "I was sold immediately, I still remember what it felt like to see that end credit scene take place. Just hearing the word 'Avengers' on screen after watching Iron Man be a great film... it was electric. \n\nIt was also the summer of The Dark Knight, and I remember having conversations at the time with my friends about how The Dark Knight was a better movie, but Iron Man was going to be the much more important movie to come out that summer. \n\nLogic being, The Dark Knight felt like a culmination of a super hero movie conceit of 'making it real', whereas Iron Man introduced the concept of not being embarrassed by being from a comic book... that confidence set the framework for the whole damn thing.\n\nOf course now a days thats not new or fresh, so it might seem quaint in retrospect... but you could see on day one (if you cared to look) that comic book storytelling was about to change for the better.", "I liked it a lot, saw it the next day, then realized Incredible Hulk probably tied in too.  Then that came out and it was clear something amazing was taking shape.  I had never thought much of Tony Stark I was always more into when he was in the suit and Thor reading comics in the 90s.  RDJ gave Tony life.  Without his portrayal in that movie we wouldn\u2019t be talking about it 17 years later much less have the biggest movie universe/franchise in cinematic history still going.", "It was really fun and a lot better then people expected it to be, a lot of people who were not usually into those kinds of movies really liked it too.  but honestly no one saw the MCU becoming what it was today", "I was 14, and went to see it on a whim with a couple of friends. I was *not* a comic reader at all and expected it to be just another superhero movie, none of which had ever really hooked me before. But wow, I LOVED it. I remember being mind blown by the way it ended, with Tony saying \u201cI am Iron Man,\u201d because I had never seen a superhero movie where the superhero didn\u2019t have a secret identity, and I remember thinking it was *so* freaking cool that he owned up to it. My friends and I all walked out of the theater babbling about how good it was and doing impressions of that last line, haha. Didn\u2019t know anything about the avengers at all, but I was super intrigued by the prospect of more. It was a game changer of a movie for me!", "Was amazing", "In all honesty I rolled my eyes at it. Iron Man was not a fan favorite when I was growing up reading comics. He seemed very one dimensional as a character. Drunk rich guy has cool toys. Then I saw the magic of the movie. It was well done. It made me care about Tony Stark. I saw the potential of setting up a \u201cmade for our time\u201d Avengers going forward. I rewatch it every so often to try and relive that sense of surprise and \u201cwhat could they do with this\u201d feeling. So, I loved it.", "I was 8 years old and I loved it, my dad and I didn\u2019t know about the post credit scenes until we get to Iron Man 2.

When we got to Iron Man 2 and the Avengers were name dropped again my dad thought it was a reference to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)). Needless to say we were pretty shocked when the Avengers came together it was an actual surprise when that movie was announced, I miss being a child with no regular internet access anymore, my young ignorance made the experience better. \n\nI really grew up with the MCU, saw every single movie in theaters until Far From Home, that broke my streak and it\u2019s been inconsistent since but I am seeing Thunderbolts tonight and this post was a fun walk back down memory lane for the MCU and myself.", "Movie came out the same year as The Dark Knight, so unfortunately didn't get the hype out deserves", "The heart -- no pun intended -- of the movie for me was scene where Pepper helps Tony fix the pacemaker he has embedded when he's laying on the table in his lab. It's funny and dramatic at the same time.  That scene was the first time where I felt like I was seeing the kind of real world vibe that I grew up seeing in Marvel comics in the Seventies. I saw the film on the Thursday before opening and I don't think it was sold out either. But audience loved it and barely anyone knew to stick around for the Sam Jackson scene post credits.", "It was goddamn awesome.   Stark's time in the cave elevated it over a lot of similar movies of the era.   On top of that I saw it with my dad who normally wouldn't be into superhero stuff but RDJ's machismo and \"hot rod\" car aesthetic to how he builds the suits really appealed to him so he loved it.   \"Ya knew he wouldn't stick to the script!\" was his words coming out of the theatre\n\nMeanwhile, while I didn't catch what Coulson was saying every time he says who he works for throughout the movie, I DEFINITELY knew what he meant when he abbreviated it to SHIELD at the end and I ABSOLUTELY knew who Sam Jackson was, so it was all I could talk about on our walk back to the car.  \n\n  \nI was SO hype.  I never imagined it would pay off as well as it does later on but damn was that a good movie.", "I was 13, incredibly hyped, but did not stay after the credits. One of my friends asked if I\u2019d seen the post credits scene a few day later and I had not because that wasn\u2019t a standard thing back then. I didn\u2019t see Nick Fury until it came out on dvd.", "It was honestly underwhelming. The only reason it was so well received was because of how low the bar was for superhero movies at that time. Honestly if Iron Man had come out after the Dark Knight instead of two months before it I don't think it would have been as big of a hit as it was.", "It was very good, and a win for comic book movies and Marvel Studios. Its success was vital to getting the MCU truly off the ground.\n\nBut this was also the summer The Dark Knight came out. Arguably a better and more important film.\n\nThis flipped when Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises came out in 2012.\u00a0", "> What was it like?\n\nIt was an enjoyable superhero flick. RDJ felt like he was born to play Tony Stark. To top it off, there was an extra credit scene too?!?\n\n> What were your thoughts?\n\nI saw this movie with a few of my former Best Buy coworkers (a number of us went to see comic book movies when they came out), and in comparison to *X-Men: The Last Stand* and *Spider-Man 3*, we were excited about what would come next, or to put it another way, we were looking forward to whatever was next. That was not a sentiment I had after either of the other movies. That was more like: if they put out another one, I will  probably watch it, but I'm not prioritizing it, I'll see it when I see it.", "At the time I thought it was the best superhero movie of all time.", "During its time, the special effects were amazing!", "Honestly, it was a good fun movie. Something fresh, quite different. But at that point you still dont know it was the start of something big. At that point, it was a fun time. Even acter Fury appeared in the credits, everybody was asking what was that. what is the Avengers. nobody knows at that point exactly what that is or what it entails. It was only after the hype built up on the other OG members that it started to sink in of what this will lead to.", "My mind was blown by the entire movie and double blown by the after credits scene. I was absolutely ecstatic about the future of Marvel movies. \n\nI'm so grateful some random stranger walked past me as I was entering the theater and told to stay through the credits. It was a once in a lifetime experience that I'll never forget.", "My mind was blown by the entire movie and double blown by the after credits scene. I was absolutely ecstatic about the future of Marvel movies. \n\nI'm so grateful some random stranger walked past me as I was entering the theater and told to stay through the credits. It was a once in a lifetime experience that I'll never forget.", "I really enjoyed it. I remember seeing it quite well. I thought it was a great film. Same year as the Dark Knight and I saw that 3 times. I remember getting a little bored of the X Men films so Iron Man was quite refreshing. \n\nOf course the post credit scene was great.\n\nI also saw Iron Man 2 in cinemas and thought it completely boring lol.", "MCU fans didn't exist in 2008. There were general Marvel fans who would see it and general audiences because it looked good, but what happened was the movie was a huge breath of fresh air that was just different. The average person may not even consider it a superhero movie and word of mouth spread like wildfire. The post-credit scene was a huge surprise and is what got people really discussing the possibility of an Avengers movie even being able to work, nobody really expected a universe to come from it which is why Thanos being hinted in Avengers itself was such a huge surprise, because it meant there was more to come.\n\nPeople were gasping when Nick Fury mentioned other heroes. Nobody had the concept of rights in their mind so everyone naturally thought that meant any other Marvel hero you had seen onscreen before.\n\nI distinctly remember hearing people say Iron Man was their new favorite superhero. These weren't comic readers or anything, just general audiences who consumed superhero movies from time to time. They knew about your Supermans, Batmans, Spider-Man and the X-Men and maybe a few of the stuff that dropped between the early to mid-2000s. Iron Man was an instant hit. It was a time of different movie culture. Everyone was asking other people if they had seen it and if you hadn't, they were saying you should.", "I really enjoyed it.  It was presented in such a matter-of-fact way that it felt fresh.  It wasn't as stylized as the Raimi Spider-Man movies, or as muted as the X-Men movies.  The suit was colorful and seemed tactile, and they trusted themselves to show it in action in broad daylight.  The cast was perfect too.  It felt like a breath of fresh air.", "I actually just happened to see it in theater because my son was 10 years old at the time and loved superhero movies, so I saw a lot of them because of him. I preferred Iron Man and the X-Men movies to many of the others(Transformers, G.I. Joe, Batman, etc.), but I wouldn\u2019t have had any idea that it would be become what we have today.", "My thoughts were mostly shock. Shock that they took a B-level character and made such a great film out of it, shock that so many other people seemed to love it, and shock that it did so well at the box office. Those feelings of shock soon after became elation. As a Marvel fan I was glad to see another really good Marvel comic book adaptation and just see it doing so well.", "I thought \"Ah ok - that was a bit better than it had any right to be, good stuff\"\n\nBut just assumed it was a standalone thing.\n\nMost people were the same. Minimal fanfare.", "Jesus Christ am I this old that there are redditors that don\u2019t remember this movie in theaters?\n\nI went in knowing very little about Iron Man or Avengers. I was always more of an X-Men fan growing up because of the animated series in the 90s. I went in thinking it would be just another superhero movie like the early 2000s Fantastic Four - fun, but ultimately forgettable. For me, it was basically an appetizer ahead of The Dark Knight which I was super pumped about that summer. I came out thinking Iron Man was cool as fuck and super excited for what would come next following the extra credit scene with Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. There was also a good amount of buzz on some old movie blogs I followed about a cool post-credit scene, that\u2019s why I stayed to watch it. we take those post-credit scenes for granted now but back then that scene was pretty revolutionary. I had no idea it would become the most successful shared movie universe in history. RDJ\u2019s comeback was also great because I basically only remembered him from his drug convictions.", "I wonder how it even got around that there was a post-credits scene, I can't imagine most people stayed through the entire credits.", "You gotta keep in mind, it came out the same summer as The Dark Knight...so THAT was the movie everyone was talking about that year. \n\nAlso, people were shocked that they gave the role to RDJ, who wasn't in the best position at the time... But still, I consider that movie a masterpiece in terms of a superhero movie. His chemistry with Paltrow was great and the post credit scene I didn't see until my 2nd time seeing it, since friends told me I missed it the first time.\n\nWho knew we'd be here now...", "I was a kid, but it still felt special. The cast and its chemistry, the snappy dialogue, the well-sprinkled humor, the pretty airtight plot. In light of movies like Spider-Man 3, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and X-Men: The Last Stand, Iron Man felt clean and focused. It knew when to go loud and when to go quiet. when to go tense and when to go light-hearted. Just like how RDJ's Tony felt earnest, so did the film.\n\nI went in as a comic fan, but I still had relatively limited knowledge of the wider Marvel Universe beyond Spider-Man. I did like Iron Man, but I hadn't had the chance to consume more media featuring him, so the movie was a big thing in consolidating my love for the character. By the time Iron Man 2 came out, Tony had become my main man.\n\nA funny story from my screeing of the movie is that I knew there was a post-credits scene featuring Nick Fury from reports on the internet, but I didn't know the details. I stayed with my father and one other group of people as the credits rolled. However, since post-credit scenes weren't a widespread phenomena, the guys at the projector pulled the film before we reached it. I overhead that other group of people complain to the usher, but there was not much to be done, so I had to look up a camrip on YouTube after coming back home.", "For context, I was in my early 40s and read mostly Avengers comic as a kid and into High School (late 80s-early 90s). \n\nI was excited to see the Dolph Lungren Punisher and the Salinger Captain America movies. \n\nI took one of my kids to see the movie and when I got home, I told my wife it was the comic book movie I had been waiting for since I was 12. \n\nThe thicket agent mentioned there was a post credit scene, but gave no spoilers. \n\nWhen Sam Jackson stepped out from the shadows I was mother fucking (pun intended) floored! \n\nI was super hyped, and doubtful that they could pull of an Avengers movie that had 5-7 super heroes in it.", "As a big movie buff and comic book fan, it was the coolest thing.\n\nI was born in 1980, so I grew up with awesome Superman movies and Batman movies, but anything outside of that was typically garbage until things like The Crow and Blade came around.\n\nHoward the Duck, Spawn, Swamp Thing, Captain America, etc just a bunch of crab.\n\nThe best action movies were typically led by an action star like Arnold, or Stallone, or Van Damme, etc. \n\nBut as the millennium was coming, those stars were disappearing.\n\nAnd once The Matrix came out, the action genre changed completely.\n\nRobert Downey Jr was considered to be a very sad tale of a total waste of talent due to drugs and alcohol.\n\nWe all really liked seeing him in his movies, but we saw so much of him in mugshots and court proceedings that the aura went away, and he kinda just disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, superhero movies started getting really good. X-Men, Spider-man, Batman Begins, just some really cool content that got us excited to see where they go from here. \n\nI would say that outside of Nolan's first 2 Batman movies, most of these movies still had a bit of cringe to them in places. They were getting better, some were even great, but there was still potential for more.\n\nAnd that's why seeing Iron Man was such an amazing experience. I didn't know a comic book movie could be that fun and enjoyable and still be really cool at the same time.\n\nSeeing RDJ look clean, confident, and giving a knock out performance was such an awesome come back feeling. We always wanted to be on that guy's side.\n\nI remember feeling like I was out of breath by the time that movie was done, it was so exciting.\n\nAnd then, \"The Avengers Initative\" comment was like an explosion on top of this already exhilarating experience.\n\n\"OH MY GAWWWD!!!\" Lol, we were so excited.", "The only thing I knew Iron Man from was  fromMarvel vs Capcom 2, but I loved that game so I was down to see what kind of story he had.\n\nImmediately it was great to see a character that's not your typical hero and starts off as a rich selfish playboy. The redemption arc was great, and RDJ had so much charisma in the role.\n\nI think a lot of people missed the post credits scene as it wasn't really a thing back then, so a lot of people were surprised to learn online there was a scene teasing the Avengers.", "I was a kid and absolutely loved it. Hadn't read a single comic, didn't know the character, and all the high tech billionaire genius explosions badassery hyped me up a lot. The cave, the suit ups. Went right back for Iron Man 2 and 3", "I loved it but more about being pumped that they nailed the vibe and tone for a comic movie. Even as a kid aside from everyone\u2019s favorites like Spider-Man 1& 2 and x2. I never liked  how Sony and fox did their super hero movies. They change everything cool and keep everything that doesn\u2019t work. \n\nI was like THIS is how you make a comic movie.", "I was 13 and just remember thinking \u201coh this is sick, hopefully they make this a trilogy like they did with Spider-Man, it would be cool to see more of this character\u201d", "Was up all night writing my last term paper freshman year of college. Turned it in and took the bus to the mall to see the 9am show. I remember it was so early there was nobody at the ticket booth or snack bar, i might have just walked straight in without paying. Went back to campus, slept all day and woke up to go to a beer pong tournament.\n\nHilarious seeing all the youngsters on here thinking superhero movie fan culture is a recent thing, there was enormous hype for this movie and it was well known that Samuel L showed up at the end way ahead of release. Thought the movie was fun but The Dark Knight was THE event of the year, seeing the midnight show that summer is a top 5 moviegoing experience of my life.", "We got a free early screening. I went with my wife and friend from work who was a big comic book fan. \nWe loved it. He said it was the best comic book adaptation he had ever seen. \n\nWe mostly went because we loved Jon Favreaus other movies and thought he would do something interesting.", "I was certainly excited but at the time, it felt like any other Marvel movie. I remember seeing it in the theater and it was a sold out showing. But then the news came out about the post-credits scene and the Avengers Initiative, I actually went and saw it again just to see that extra scene! I thought it was a fun Easter egg, who knew it would turn into such a huge thing and become a part of my life! A few months later, The Dark Knight stole its thunder and became the talk of the town with Heath Ledger's performance and possibly winning Oscars so the thought about the MCU was very far from my mind in 2008.", "As a bright-eyed 11 year-old when it came out, I absolutely loved it.", "i remember thinking after that summer that Iron Man was the best comic book movie ever made and The Dark Knight was the best graphic novel movie ever made.", "Very different feel from today\u2019s MCU. It was a little more \u201cgrown up,\u201d if you will, and the serious parts were more traditional Hollywood action serious.\n\nBut yes it definitely felt like it led into something bigger and building a movie universe.\n\nVery ambitious and bold since at that point oftentimes actors didn\u2019t play the same character too many times, let alone an entire group of actors, although Harry Potter made it possible, so there was a lot of hope that this could work too.", "I've been an Iron Man fan for a while, so it was awesome to see him done justice. Hearing Favreau insert [the old 1960s cartoon theme tune](https://youtu.be/LjTIVaSnRR0?feature=shared) a few places [here](https://youtu.be/OEnUcgIzzM0?si=kd1lRqTHXZ1Q-B6U) and [there](https://youtu.be/_873UeiwnVA?si=F_ZbJOBn9CDVFWUS) told me that we were in good hands; a fan was directing. I had already been hyped by the trailer (of course, [most people were](https://youtu.be/YBM3j7x4Lcw?si=RSts6UzXtZ5DETAn)), but I was staying cautious in my optimism. But the movie was awesome. It had everything; slapstick with the tests and DUM-E, suspense with Pepper and Stane, action, sexytimes, explosions and a sarcastic virtual butler.", "I LOVED it! I was a (not diehard) comic book fan and had mixed reactions to most previous superhero movies. For instance it really bothered me that the Spider-Man movies kept killing off his best villains. \nIron Man and Incredible Hulk which both came out in 2008 just felt like they took the story more seriously and didn\u2019t try to shy away from how comics *work*.", "The Mark II suit-up scene was epic. Then the Gulmira scene was awesome. Just seeing him pick them apart.", "I thought it was very well done, and it being so comic book accurate really made it work.  Downey was Tony Stark.", "It was a really good, above average comic book movie. The after credits scene was exciting for its sheer potential, but it felt like such a distant thing. It was totally overshadowed by The Dark Knight that year, which felt like a seismic moment in cinema at the time.", "Character and tone was what set this one apart at the time. It was really refreshing and light on its feet compared to most of the superhero movies that came before. A lot of that had to do with Robert Downey Jr.'s performance, but it was also one of the first times where it felt like they didn't have to compromise too much in depicting the hero's powers (in this case the suit).", "It was amazing and is still one of my favourite movies. Iron Man has always been one of my favourite superheroes so I was super excited that he finally got a movie.", "For my friends and I it wasn\u2019t just a really good superhero movie, it was fucking awesome. Even better than Batman Begins, which was stellar.", "Not a comic reader but I enjoyed the movie a lot. It's still top 5 MCU movies. Also after the credit scene my friends went nuts with the reveal meanwhile me and another person was like ok what is shield?", "I was still pretty young - I was in 6th grade in 2008, so I was like 11 or 12 years old. I vividly remember seeing it in theaters with my dad, and we both absolutely loved it. I was already a massive Spider-Man fan, having grown up on the Raimi movies and reruns of the 90s cartoon. \n\nWasn't a comic reader yet because there were no shops anywhere near where I grew up, so I didn't know much about any character who wasn't an A-lister at the time (I.e. All of the avengers haha). I had obviously seen many of them but knew pretty much nothing.\n\nWe also had no clue about the MCU or anything relating to this being a shared universe prior, and for a while after too. I feel like \"insider news\" on this stuff wasn't as readily available online so I just didn't see any sort of discussion. As far as we knew, it was the same as Spider Man or Fantastic Four - a standalone thing. We didn't even see the post credit scene cause we didn't know to stay \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Well for me I was a child, like 10-11 yrs old. I also didn't have regular access to the Internet/WiFi to know about the post credit scene, because I don't remember having a reaction to the Nick Fury scene. So I'm guessing my family walked out before I could see it. But of course the movie itself was amazing. I only knew about IM through games and cartoons, so I was hyped to see something new. \n\nI'm actually not even sure when I learned it would be a bigger universe tbh.", "The internet was so different then. I was still in highschool when Iron Man was announced. Back then alot of my comic book movie news came from reading Wizard mag and rumors on message boards. There were rumblings of Nick Fury and SHIELD but man watching Iron Man for the first time was special. You could tell the movie was sowing seeds and not in an easter egg way. Then when that post credit hit it was like WHOA SAM FUCKING JACKSON as Nick Fury. Theyre doing it!", "For me I went to the movie thinking it would be a one off dumb action flick. I was an iron man back in the day. I collected the comics but i was not expecting much from the movie given that at the time iron man was a b to c type character. After the movie I was blown away. I did not even fathom how much i would enjoy this movie. \n\nI still liked the dark knight movie more however iron man made so many freaking awesome turns. The first was Phil saying the name of agency to Pepper, she starts to say the full name, then phil cuts her off and said just call us shield. I had a mind blown. \n\nThen the biggest and freaking awesome change for me was Tony telling everyone he is iron man. Usually in superhero costume movies like batman, batman does everything he can to hid his identity even though half the characters know by the end so having Tony blurt it out was sooooo awesome.", "I was 12 when it came out and it was the coolest movie I had ever seen I was already a comicbook nerd but it really blew my mind at the time", "It was an insane experience. All the kids at my school were talking about it, we would compare him to Spider-Man, Batman etc. I also had all the toys", "I was 13 when it came out, saw it with my family. All 4 of us enjoyed it and were excited that it was getting a sequel.", "I am a comic book fan, my wife is not. I talked her into seeing it. She thought it was okay, a cheesy superhero movie, and she appreciated the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow. \n\nI thought it was entertaining, better than expected.   \n  \nIt was brilliant that out of all the possible B-list heroes, Marvel started things out with Iron Man -- a technology-based superhero, which seemed like it required the least amount of suspension-of-disbelief in 2008, when all kinds of tech had really matured, from iPhones to broadband. And Samuel J Jackson was actually cast as Nick Fury, and that Adi Granov's design was appropriated (and later properly recognized). \n\nWas totally convinced Thor would flop, and that Avengers would never gel properly. I gave up trying to second-guess after GotG -- a Z-list comic book title -- was a hit.", "It came at a perfect time. CBMs were starting to become a new Hollywood norm over the previous decade plus, but obviously none of the Marvel projects were tied in together. So they felt more like the comics where there was a sporadic nature to the storytelling. \n\nI think audiences were ready for more, though. Coming off the X-Men and Raimi trilogies, crossovers were more in demand. Iron Man was a weird litmus test on paper because he wasn\u2019t an A-list level hero. He was liked, but took a backseat to the other marvel characters who have had multiple eras of live action projects. The premise of the movie was interesting and RDJ had just gotten back in some people\u2019s good graces with a few notable performances. People wanted it to be good.\n\nThe moment that I knew something special was in the works was the shot of Iron Man with the explosives in the background. The CGI on the suit to this day is flawless. The post credit scene  was the first time we marvel fans felt real hype for crossover potential. \n\nNo one could have imagined it\u2019d turn into arguably the greatest movie franchise of all time (by far) but the formula was there. The heart, the comedy, the action. The production process was really organic. Very little corporate interference and a ton of improv. You can feel that on screen. It\u2019s still my favorite MCU movie.", "Was really cool I was like 9 or 10 and the movies still ingrained in my brain all these years", "Saw it opening night and loved it.  Waiting in line, the staff of the theater were very excited for us to see it and went along the line imploring us to stay for the post-credit sequence (Usually theaters don't want you to that because they they have no time to clean.)", "It felt like another super hero movie to me but in an upper tier like Spider Man 2.  You must realize, this was the same summer as The Dark Knight and once that was released, I forgot about Iron Man.  I didn't realize how big the MCU would get once I saw The Avengers, my mind was blown and I was 100% in.", "Instantly fell in love with rdj and iron man. Never knew that hero from marvel.\n\nHad a craving for cheeseburger from Burger King as I came out of the theater to my dad car and throughout the week", "I'm of the age where X-men were my first and deepest exposure to Marvel. They were all the rage in the 90s and were what got me interested into Marvel. Spiderman was cool and had a few movies. The Hulk was awesome but wasn't overly exposed.\n\nGoing into Iron Man, I was open. I liked RDJ and thought he was great casting. To be fair, I didn't know much beyond the surface about Iron Man, because he was never popular in culture. The movie was great. It dealt vaguely with terrorism and the military industrial complex during a time of endless war.\n\nWhen he said \"I am Iron Man\" at the end, the theater erupted. You could tell this was something different. A better comic book movie than we had seen for many years. The after-credits was amazing. I was all in.", "I watched it because I remember watching the 90s cartoon. My friend was an comic book reader that knew the basics of Earth 616 and the groups and what not.\n\nIt was awesome seeing the special effects and see a man fly. I thought we hit the limit cgi could create with Spiderman but seeing Iron Man was just orgasmic. Especially the HUD. Just freaking phenomenal.\n\nOh and had no idea who SHIELD, Avengers, or Nick Fury were. Besides the Punisher game.", "I was not a huge Marvel fan but I knew Iron Man well and always thought he was an interesting character. I was also not super hyped because super hero movies had mostly been pretty bad for a while - I love Batman and enjoyed Batman Begins, but the Dark Knight hadn\u2019t come out yet. I\u2019m also a big movie guy, and fan of Favreau, so I was curious and cautiously optimistic, but mostly expected another Daredevil or Fantastic Four. \n\nI really liked the first two acts, all of the setup, Downey and his irreverence, and the CGI was great for the time. But the third act felt very rushed, like they had just remembered they needed a big villain and kinda decided at the last minute to put Bridges in that suit and have a big fight.  It left me feeling a bit bored and unfulfilled. What I did enjoy was his big reveal and bucking of a secret identity at the end, and the Avengers tease. Both felt original and fresh and kept me interested. \n\nI hated the Incredible Hulk and enjoyed Thor and Captain America, but thought they felt like watered down imitations of better movies, especially after Sark Knight. It was the Avengers that really hooked me and got me into everything. (I\u2019ve since come  to appreciate the first Cap a bit more. Fun movie.)\n\nSide note - I watched Iron Man recently and was so surprised to see how much it aged! 2007/2008 styles and humor, etc. but it was a fun rewatch.", "I think it's more than \"I saw it, and it was good.\"\n\nFrom 1998-2005, comic book movies were really picking up steam. They weren't perfect, but we were still excited for the future. X2, Batman Begins, Sin City, V for Vendetta, Spider-Man 2, Hellboy, Blade 2. All great. 2006-2007 and Spider-Man 3, Ghost Rider, Superman Returns, FF 2, and X-Men 3 kinda divided fans. I felt like it left us in a bit of a dull time except for 300. \n\nIron Man gets announced to have RDJ, and people are like \"well that's just good casting.\" We see our first picture of him with the beard and thinking it could work. But you gotta remember how tight 2008 was. You had Iron Man, Hulk, Hellboy 2, and motherfucking The Dark Knight all coming out in the span of a few months. People were talking about how Incredible Hulk could possibly have Iron Man, but one is Paramount, and one is Universal, so it seemed impossible. The trailers, clips, and pics made it seem like yeah, they're trying to do a good job. They want to take it seriously and do it right, not some tongue-in-cheek toy commercial.\n\nIt comes out, and people are like, \"STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!\" So you get a pretty good movie that has action and laughs. It was well written and directed. It made a lot of people into Iron Man fans. It felt like comic book movies were totally back now. We had a slump, but we're coming back. The after-credits though blows our minds, and now we have all these ideas of what IS coming. There's excitement again. People talked about Iron Man quite a bit until TDK came out. A lot of people compare MCU films today, but back then, you compared Iron Man to say Daredevil or Punisher. It really held the title for best Marvel film until the MCU started becoming an actual thing.\n\nI never really thought while sitting through Iron Man that one day I was going to see the Avengers try to stop Thanos, Spider-Man fight Captain America, comic accurate Galactus, or even Wolverine rip someone up with his claws. Tell me that 20 years ago, and I'd have chuckled.", "i mean hero movies before iron man 1 were like. nolans batman which was good the 3rd spiderman movie which was bad the 3rd xmen movie which was terrible fantastic 4 which was trash and that one pretty bad superman movie daredevil which was bad. nobody really thought it would become this big cause tbh nobody really cared about marvel pre mcu. most people liked DC far more. nolans 2nd bad man movie came out like either a month or two before or after and it was pretty much all anyone talked about outside of clowning on iron mans theme song by going \" i am iron man i jack off with my right hand\"", "Me then: They should make more movies like this!\u00a0\n\nMe now: Not that many more.\u00a0", "I was surprised it was as good as it was. I was excited but I didn't expect it to actually be such a strong film. Superhero movies were definitely not a guaranteed money maker.", "I remember most the video of Iron flying that they showed in the previous Comicon. I remember being really hyped cause we knew they were gonna Cap and Thor next and they would all meet in Avengers (an unprecedented thing in movies back then). Watching Ironman in theaters was really fun and the post credits scene was mind blowing.", "I was happy to see one of my first favourite superheroes on screen.  I felt like the whole superhero genre just gained some more legitimacy.  And it's still a great, fun, and funny movie.", "I enjoyed it!!! Of course I was just a kid, but I thought it was the coolest movie ever!", "The story was great but the action was underwhelming.   \nThe suit-up was the best thing about it.", "This is it. It was exciting but I had no idea that it was leading somewhere until the dots started linking together.", "Exactly my wife and I. She considers the first Iron Man movie to be the best MCU movie in terms of tone and balancing humor with action with drama. At this point, she's also pretty done with superhero movies in general.", "I remember thinking the post credits was cool but never thinking it was actually going to lead to anything big.", "As a high school kid I thought it was mind-blowing, especially the first full suiting up sequence.", "Yep. It was a good movie with a fun nod to fans at the end about the \"avenger initiative\". Then Dark Knight came out later that summer, and that was mind-blowing.", "Right? Christopher Nolan really flipped a semi truck and blew up a building disguised as a hospital in TDK.\n\nThat movie was truly groundbreaking.\n\nIron Man showed that marvel heroes other than Spider-Man and Xmen could be a resounding success. That\u2019s worth a mention\u00a0", "Not the extent, but Incredible Hulk was just a few months later.

As the fate of Earth hangs in the balance, the team is put to the ultimate test as they battle Ultron, a technological terror hell-bent on human extinction. Along the way, they encounter two mysterious and powerful newcomers, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff.\u201d\n\nLooking back at the film 10 years later, what did you think about it? Did you change your mind about it? Do you still like it to this day or just never liked it since it came out? And what are some changes you would\u2019ve changed in it?\n\nMe personally I\u2019ll have to say that I was still young so I was not all familiar with the comics yet, but I will say that I did really like how Ultron was in the film even if there\u2019s a lot of problems with how he\u2019s portrayed in the mcu compared to his comics self and other media (especially cause not many liked his design but I thought it worked well), and I feel like when it comes to the \u201cTony creating ultron vs Hank pym creating ultron\u201d debate, I think the mcu did it well with the Tony creating ultron, even though this already existed before in the next avengers animated film prior to the mcu, jumping forward years later when I began to read more comics, I can agree that Hank should be the creator of ultron (also I did watched the emh show before reading comics too, but then again, I was young, I wasn\u2019t all that familiar with the comics but I did still like it regardless and Ultron in emh is very much so his best adaptation, and I agree years later today!), but in the mcu, Tony being his creator I think works well for what it is.\n\nAnd it sucks how this would be the last we\u2019ll see the original 6 avengers together because after that they aren\u2019t together again until endgame, but I still really liked their dynamic in the film either way, not sure what to feel about the whole Bruce x Natasha thing the film tried setting up but I think it\u2019s\u2026fine, but still really like everyone getting to interact with each other without having it be a mission and especially the party scene (well, before Ultron interrupted).\n\nI also feel like this movie made me like the mcu a whole lot more, I did see iron man 3, gotg vol 1, and the winter soldier prior to it but I guess it didn\u2019t like really peaked my liking to the series yet until age of ultron.\n\nAnd I still find it pretty good 10 years later, it holds a special place in my heart cause it\u2019s where I really began to like the mcu a lot and still find it to be a good film, probably not top 10 best mcu films ever but still good regardless\n\nBut anyways yeah, that\u2019s how I feel about the film (and my story about it too), did it increase your interest in the mcu same as me?

After engaging the warp drive, things go catastrophically wrong when a cosmic storm hits knocking them off course as Ben tries to redirect them back to earth.\n\n**ACT 2: STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LAND**\nReed wakes up in a hospital on a technologically advanced planet called Tarsuu where he learns 1) all of them have been mutated and 2) they were thrown into the orbit of a black hole and were in stasis for 2 weeks before being rescued by a Tarsuuan explorer but due to time dilation 12+ years passed on earth(taking them up to the current MCU timeline and avoiding dealing with the snap). As Reed obsessively works to cure them, through a device called the bridge that allows the Tarsuuans to look into other universes, they discover their accident was caused by energy from a cosmic control rod leaking from the Negative Zone - and its ruler Annihilus who goes around destroying positive matter universes, is preparing an \"Annihilation Wave\" to send to the main MCU.\n\n**ACT 3: THE NEGATIVE ZONE WAR**\nThe team leads a desperate assault into the Negative Zone to destroy Annihilus' dimensional bridges. In spectacular action sequences, we see their powers and teamwork fully realized.\n\nThe emotional climax comes when Ben must choose between seizing the Cosmic Control Rod (which might cure them) or saving Reed's life - choosing his friend over his own humanity. Escaping as their portal into the Negative Zone collapses behind them, they return to a Tarsuu that sees them as heroes.\n\nWith upgraded ship technology, the Four head home - only to be intercepted by SWORD and asked to identify themselves. The final scene being Reed asking \u201cIs this how you treat a long lost friend\u201d to which Fury replies \"Reed Richards?!\"\n\n**Post Credit**\nBack in Tarsuu we see the Tarsuuans panic while looking over the bridge as they start to witness entire universes disappear/be destroyed hunting towards the multiversal collapse.", "author": "ResourceTiny", "upvotes": 0, "postID": "1kd417u", "postImage": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kd417u/main_mcu_fantastic_4_pitch/", "postUrl": "/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kd417u/main_mcu_fantastic_4_pitch/", "comments": ["I have a more detailed pitch but to just add some context. My idea here is to pitch an F4 origin story that would\u2019ve tied into the context of the main MCU blending it\u2019s past and future without having to be an alternate universe movie like first steps so to go over a few points. \n\nThe start of the movie is set during the Hydra era of shield when they were using the tesseract for weapons. In this case Reed & co were recruited for a secret project to create a warp drive enabling interstellar travel. An early subplot here is that Reed & Sue had already cracked the hard drive but lied to SHIELD for weeks about setbacks because they discovered it had been infiltrated by Hydra and they didn\u2019t want that power in Hydra\u2019s hands. This prompts them to hijack the ship that was built for the drive and go themselves. \n\nWe then get the cosmic storm which will be revealed to have been caused by Annihilus\u2019 cosmic control rod tying the F4 getting their powers to Annihilus. Both of these ideas specifically but this pitch as a whole were inspired by a YouTube video I just watched but can\u2019t remember the name of. \n\nWe then get to act 2 where we are now on an alien world that\u2019s super advanced. This serves to give the movie its space exploration element but also sets up the multiversal tie in to future MCU movies. Before being rescued the idea is that when the storm knocked them off course it sent them into orbit around a blackhole where they were in stasis for some time before being rescued but due to time dilation around this black hole over a decade had passed on earth so that this would explain why the F4 hadn\u2019t existed in the MCU to date."], "category": "hot", "linkTitle": "Too Many Requests"}

I know that they're eventually going to combine into one sUpER Av3nGErS, so this doesn't matter, but then, who's gonna lead them?

Seeing Thor 2 does make the Asgard scenes in Endgame even better though since you get to see more of the dynamic between Thor and his mother.\n\nBut I do think if the goal is to get to Infinity War and Endgame, then Ragnarok is pretty important for understanding what's going on in Infinity War's opening scene as well as Thor's plotline throughout Infinity War (it's also just a *really* fun movie, so it's not like you're adding homework onto the watchlist)", "Wholly disagree. I hadn\u2019t seen any of the Thor movies or the avengers, and I absolutely loved Thor Ragnar\u00f6k. It actually led me into watching the rest of the portfolio sans the first two iron man movies, the second of which made me stop watching the MCU stuff.", "the entire infinity saga is worth watching in release order. and the phases are good progress markers if 23 films seems overwhelming", "if you dont want to overwhelm her, just do release order up to Avengers, and then take a few months off.  Go for the next few if shes still curious", "plus Thor 1 is important for setting up Loki for The Avengers. Also dont think you should skip Iron Man 2 (but can definitely skip IM3)", "Are you?", "Yeah, hot take, but I think the first Thor movie is the second worst of the Thor's, and the worst isn't even Dark World. Love & Thunder, Thor, The Dark World, then Ragnarok being the best.\n\nEdit: if you really want her to be a fan and watch new movies and shows with you, she's gotta see everything. She'll think it's daunting at first, but in the end, she'll be grateful", "I think that's underestimating the work Marvel puts into providing context in their movies for the people who *haven't* followed along with absolutely every release.\n\nIn the list provided for example, Thor is skipped over, and while watching Thor will help fill in some gaps and give context for him when he appears in The Avengers, Thor still introduces himself to Shield and the other Avengers since he hasn't met them before, and his first scene with Loki does a pretty good job establishing what their relationship is. I don't think many people would wind up feeling totally lost if that was their first introduction to the characters.\n\nIt reminds me of how people worried that both Wandavision and Ms Marvel would be \"required viewing\" to be able to understand The Marvels, but Carol hadn't seen Monica in decades, so obviously a talk about how she suddenly has powers now was going to have to happen (which covers Monica's relevant plot points from Wandavision), and none of these characters had ever met Kamala before, so she was naturally going to end up introducing herself and explaining what her deal is (which covers any relevant information you would have needed from Ms Marvel).", "Plus, if you want to keep going, you get Fury and Carol to carry you through.", "I treat it as canon, I know it probably isn't though. \nI treat Season 1-5 as part of the sacred timeline, then Endgame and Loki unlock the Multiverse allowing for 6&7 to take place in an alternate timeline.", "Bitter?

In the comics, it was a years-long sort of examination in which it was revealed that lots of fan favorite characters had been skrulls for years, featuring major superheroes and overall just being this dreadful thriller. The show was kind of more of a quiet drama about Nick Fury finding out that Rhodey was a skrull... and that was the extent of the \"thrills.\" It's really not a terrible show, but it's a terrible adaptation, and people who tuned in for Secret Invasion are pissed off about it.", "That\u2019s all true, but the humor and emotions all work because you\u2019ve spent that time investing in them, even if you missed dark world.

You don\u2019t need to go back to Thor after avengers for context on who selvig or loki are, and if you know how avengers starts you know how Thor ends. Point being; if you care about view order, watch them in order. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t matter. It either matters and the answer is \u201cin order\u201d or it doesn\u2019t and there\u2019s no answer.", "Good way to look at it.

I wonder why only 8 reviews are showing up though when I click view all reviews. Maybe it\u2019s a mobile site issue.", "The reason why the score is hidden is because RT is all about the Tomatometer. They used to display more detail, but now they've reduced it to their simpler branded metric. It's not really a question of which is more accurate, because they measure different things.\n\nBut you make a good point - someone who rates out of 4 is giving a rating with less precision. If they give it a 3/4 they may have leaned towards a 14 or 16 out of 20 had they used that system. We don't know. But we do know they gave it a 3/4, which is mathematically equal to 15/20. I think that's a totally reasonable assumption to make when aggregating reviews.\n\nThe way I would treat letters would be to transfer it to a numerical system by counting the number of possible letter grades and then seeing where a given grade fits in that system.

So a single shield might make many loops, but I think they would always end up escaping the loop. \n\nThis isn't even taking shield repairs into consideration, or the fact that a 2023 Steve would probably not take an almost entirely decayed shield back in time.", "I mean, yeah. My personal guess is Steve sought out the Wakandans using his knowledge of the future and asked of them to create a new shield for Sam, and that's why the one Steve gives to Sam has greeble lines on the silver ring", "Read this in Walter White's voice.", "And even if they were magnetic, you would need an insanely strong magnet to stop and hold a bullet from the speed it's moving at.", "B b b bb", "I think he lost it because it was one of the toys and gadgets funded by shield, which was dismantled in the winter soldier movie. my timeline could be way off though so idk lol", "You can see in the beginning fight of Civil War that the straps are back when Cap drops his shield chasing after Crossbones.

Science, bitch", "Maybe an O shaped magnet, I think I\u2019ll call it the Magnet-O", "Yeah, the timeline is off because Age of Ultron was after Winter Soldier and he would\u2019ve had it during Winter Soldier.", "He doesn't create another timeline he just teleports to another place within that timeline", "There must be a timeline where hulk hits tony and the space stone isnt stolen by Loki but rather returned to the proper avengers in that timeline.

Are they maybe slowly introducing a new opening logo animation for next year's Avengers movie?", "I loved it. It felt different but in a good way.

Felt like a much needed change from the recent MCU shenanigans, just good plot, good pacing, and good acting. Even though I wasn't hyped at first, I knew Florence would absolutely deliver.. and she did. I did not expect to feel some emotions while watching but damn.\n\nOnly slight nitpick for me was the lack of others' visions when they went into the void, would have loved to see even just a glimpse of it  but it would have dragged the 3rd act.

Let them be a huge part of the next era moving forward, we desperately need the consistency.", "The first movie since Captain Marvel where the post credit scene is related to the next movie", "100% loved this movie. Perfect balance between action, emotion and comedy. It's up there next to Winter Soldier for me. Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman are the MVPs. Even though the rest are mostly side characters, I did feel like they could have shown a bit of Bucky and Ava's \"void\" scenes and them confronting their dark pasts (Bucky as the Winter Soldier and Ava as an assassin/spy for SHIELD). Taskmaster was basically a one-line cameo who got her ass beat.\n\nSecond post-credit scene really felt like we're brought back to early Marvel days where we're teased with something that's actually important. I think this movie exceeded all expectations and the Director did a great job because it wasn't trying to be a cameo-fest/fan service movie like Multiverse of Madness/D&W and they didn't reveal everything about Sentry/Void before the movie came out (vs Red Hulk in BNW).\n\nAlso I'm so glad they didn't go with the final third act being a big CGI fight. I'm actually rooting for this team and can't wait to see more of them.", "What a phenomenal film, not only as a Marvel production but just an inherently brilliant movie overall. Absolutely loved the allegorical plot of mental health in different forms and stages amongst all of the main cast. They bounced off each other comedically and emotionally far better than I could have imagined. \n\nI haven\u2019t read a huge amount of Sentry/Void stories but it is a beautiful depiction of the horrors associated with PTSD, schizophrenia, and anxiety. That character and storyline was a perfect fit for the Thunderbolts and what the movie wanted to achieve.\n\nIn terms of being a Marvel movie, this was very unique in the context of the MCU but it worked so well. The A24 film comparisons are spot on. It didn\u2019t need the spectacle that other highly rated MCU movies have, its success came from the emotional crescendo. The pacing felt just right, and the third act was an extremely well crafted culmination. \n\nYelena and Bob certainly stole the show both plot and performance wise. Both actors deserve awards for this and I really hope that being a Marvel movie doesn\u2019t discount them. The scene in which Yelena pours her heart out to Alexei might be the single best piece of acting in the MCU to date, Florence Pugh absolutely killed it. I cannot wait to see more of Bob and really hope he plays a major part moving forward to Doomsday, Secret Wars and beyond. \n\nThe only gripes I may have are that Ava/Ghost felt a little out of place. It just felt like her absence wouldn\u2019t have made a whole lot of difference. I really think the movie could have done with an extra 10 minutes to show what the other Thunderbolts saw in The Void. Which leads me to my next point in Bucky, who served well as a mentor and unifier of the team but took a bit of a backseat plot wise.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favourite MCU films to date. I honestly would not even want to try to rank them anymore as it would be far too difficult. If it came down to critically rating them all, I absolutely feel like Thunderbolts is top 5. Also, the credits scenes were top tier. Sooooo hyped for what\u2019s to come.", "Props to Red Guardian turning his limo into a hobo man's Batmobile. The slowpoke speed, and molotov cocktail as a defensive countermeasure was funny.", "I see why there's a positive buzz around this film... it's actually about something human and relatable. Much like Tony dealing with PTSD in Iron Man 3 but on a much more sincere stage. It's a very character driven film and the misfits are more than surface level broken. It's great to see one of these films commit to such a positive message (good friends can help you defeat the darker aspects of your character and personality) while actually committing to a visual metaphor of dark depression... and there's some great superhero fights too!\n\nUS Agent still carrying his taco shield 14months later was the icing on the cake. Top tier MARVEL.", "14 months later: WIGS", "I really like the parallel of Natasha and Bruce with Yelena and Bob.", "I was so so so worried they\u2019d repeat Suicide Squad 1\u2019s biggest mistake: having street level powered people go up against world ending threat *with no good justification or resolution*\n\nT* handled it sooooo well", "I would love to ride on Bob into the sky.", "Glad they recast Sentry. Lewis Pullman really nailed it here.", "Maybe I glitched out during the film, but in making the experimental drug that Bob took, did the government essentially make on Earth an enhanced being with power that seems maybe stronger than anyone we've seen in the MCU? I get that the Sentry's origin here is mostly the same as in the comics from what I remember. Still I was thinking that's a pretty crazy leap with Earth-bound serum/drugs without the help of some nutty cosmic artifact or advanced tech. Unless I missed something?", "Really glad they did Sentry/The Void well!", "Loved the on your left moment from Walker", "Damn I knew Taskmaster would bite the dust, but it still feels weird how they legit just got her out of the MCU right quick, and the narrative doesn't even linger on her demise.\n\n\nWell, that's one way to fix the issue of Kurylenko being 45 in real life, but playing like a 25 year old in the MCU.", "Back from the theatre.  What a blast this movie was.  Florence was amazing.  Loved the chemistry between them all.  Bucky still got his knife skills and did he look good on that motorcycle - T2 Arnie eat your heart out.  David Harbour stole every scene he was in.  I love Hannah John-kamens voice, she could read the phone book to me.  Always too to see JLD.  Everyone knocked it out of the park.  Enjoy good folks\n\nEdit, forgot to add we received a free poster on arrival.", "I did love it, but I still needed more Bucky. I don't know. I kinda feel he should be the leader, and it seemed that Yelena is unofficially leader. I do love her, though. She's one of the best new characters. \n\nIt's still a solid movie, in my humble opinion. I just loves me some Bucky.", "I liked that they leaned into the mental health x family themes instead of going balls out on action.\n\nI cried twice in the film as a DV survivor, it was so touching (it wasnt explicitly stated but in some ways the the Widow project def felt like an allegory for prostitution). The scene where it implies Bob was hiding in the attic from having to watch his father terrorize his family. It was heartbreaking.\n\nYelena admitting that she feels so fucking alone \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udec2, she easily shot up to 5 of my fav MCU ongoing story arcs so far.\n\nTHE F4 TEASER AT THE ENDDS AJHHHHH", "Genuinely very good. Fun, breezes by without a check of the watch, nor formulaic, nicely funny without trying too hard to be.\n\nMaking it a Florence Pugh film is smart, they treated all the characters well (Bucky was my fear), eliminated a supposed big player early, but having her as the real lead was good for the film and good use of the actress. She\u2019s a star. \n\nLoved Sentry. They made a big deal out of him without doing too much, and the darkness of him carried through, although others who have read more comics than me (a casual reader) probably have strong opinions there. \n\nThe end credits tease was great, so simple but made me so excited for F4! \n\nThis had no points where I felt like I was in the machine of the MCU, and none of those moments in the story where you had to force yourself to ignore the plot choices or the how, where, why of it all, which is essential and has been an issue lately.\n\nNot a No Way Home or GOTG3 classic, but a very enjoyable entry with real rewatch potential.", "Whoever directed Thunderbolts should have directed Brave New World, and should direct more Marvel movies. It had a great balance between comedy, action, shock value, emotional moments.\nThe action was good, the characters were actually interesting. \nWe should have gotten a movie like this in the earlier phases. \nAlso, that meet up scene was crazy good. Not to mention the drive through the desert. Hilarious.\n8/10.", "Soo Walker just always rocks the taco shield now? I can dig it haha", "I'm just REALLY glad there wasn't some super stupid explanation for the \\*\n\nI mean the name was kinda stupid but I thought that humour was well placed.", "This really is the A24 of the MCU. Florence Pugh brought her A game and no one is surprised, but everyone on the cast was amazing as well and meshed so perfectly together. Love the scene where everyone got together to save civilians, and making the third act not just fighting is a bold move that paid off narratively (and hopefully financially). A post credits scene setting up something coming immediately also felt rare these days, and it\u2019s such an icing on the cake. I wonder if there\u2019ll be some kind of a twist though since we are essentially spoiled that the F4 will lose their universe.", "I didn't cry when Black Widow died.\n\nI didn't cry when Iron Man died.\n\nBut I was ugly sobbing when Bob was repeatedly punching the Void. \n\n10/10 will most likely see it in cinemas again.", "Despite their dull costumes and similar powers, I never expected to leave this movie wanting them to be MY Avengers over Sam Wilson's. They really did a great job of making me like these terribly flawed and imperfect people, some who I previously loathed. Together they had great chemistry, bouncing off each other so well in combat and when conversing. Well done! So fun!", "Me before watching Thunderbolts: Who cares about them. Bunch of side characters.\n\nAfter watching it: Oh gosh give me more!! Love their chemistry! And more Bob!!", "I fucking love those end credit with magazine cover/poster homage of how hard Val push for the New Avengers and how the public \"hate\" the New Avengers", "While the tone of the movie wasn't Winter Soldier serious, it's definitely one of the darker MCU movies, with comedy that felt appropriate, not ruining the more dramatic scenes. \n\nI was pleasently surprised that Yelena was the lead of the movie. She had a great arc and the scene with her and the red guardian was really touching. The movie could've been a bit longer though since some characters felt a bit underdeveloped. \n\nAlso shoutout to Yelena for saving the guinea pig.", "I find it weird how they spoil the ending of the next film despite it being the obvious ending when dealing with Galactus and a multiverse saga", "Something else. 14 months is a long ass time. I wonder if anything in between that time will be talked about in the future. Have the New Avengers been accepted by society yet? They fight anybody else? And what has Bob been doing this whole time? What can he do since he can't really cut loose with The Void as the consequence. Really interested in how they handle him down the line.", "As a Malaysian, that shot of the Kuala Lumpur skyline backdrop after Yelena lands with her parachute was deliberately framed.

Yelena obviously carried it, but loved what Walker brought to the dynamic. He\u2019s been one of my favourite post-endgame additions to the MCU.\n\nAnd the post credit scene was just crazy. I was spoiled by the credits referencing their theme, but was still fantastic to see their logo appear.\n\nYelena mentioned the \u201cspace crisis\u201d, which I think is separate to the arrival of the F4? I guess we can assume that\u2019s the beginning of an incursion maybe?", "Long have I waited to see Ghost again.

Doesn't matter much, because that entire sequence was still awesome, and funny.", "Awww man in a few days there will be a contingent of folks putting this movie on a spitroast labeling it as \"woke\" because it tackles mental health as the big bad instead of the standard finale brawl.

Solid 8/10, post credit scene got me hyped", "Yup watched it in Hong Kong a few hours ago. Think the movie structure is solid and not like some Marvel tin-can production. This movie obviously has heart, and she's called Yelena. Florence Plugh once again nailed it (was that ever a doubt?).

A fantastic performance by Pullman and great chemistry with Florence.", "You know since Moon Knight showed split personalities are cosmically recognised as their own persons, it\u2019s interesting that the Void or the Sentry side could count as their own persons and souls per MCU cosmology right now.\n\nAlso Bob should totally meet Moon Knight", "Most powerful sis in the universe\n\nBig sis lulls the Hulk\n\nLil sis hugs the Void", "Seeing the trailer I thought what bullshit Marvel will pull from their ass to defeat The Void, what we got is a good execution of the story.\n\n\nAnd yeah that end credit scene will be one important thing going forward. Probably Doomsday will start on that point.", "Kinda happy Bob didn\u2019t kill himself to stop the void since they are the same being. \n\nCould you imagine if the clinically depressed character saved the day through suicide\u2026", "Definitely an amazing project! I already loved Yelena but now she's one of my favorites. Florence Pugh's acting is incredible. Hoping to see another movie with this team after Secret Wars!", "7/10! Can sneak up to a 7.5!\n\nIt i indeed a breath of fresh air in the MCU, and the direct setup for the next movie gave me \"good ol' MCU vibes\"!\n\nI will say this. I do think the movie and the plot was predictable. No big surprise twists in my opinion. But unlike other MCU movies with a predictable plot, it was well-written and well-executed. And yet, while the plot was predictable, it sticks the landing. And it never went astray from the plot either. It was one smooth line from start to finish, with perfect pacing.\n\nThe scene where Bucky is going after them, was my first moment of feeling the MCU is back. That scene, for some reason, stood out for me, gave me goosebumps and made me think \"we are so back!\"\n\nClearly, Yelena and Bob are the main characters. And they execute it so well. The dynamic between the 2 of them, and also between them and the rest of the team for that matter, is great. What I slightly missed though, was a trip into the void, or into the shadows, with Red Guardian, Bucky and Ghost as well. We only have that brief moment there with Yelena and Walker. They could easily have added 10-15 minutes extra there, without it hurting the movie.\n\nNow, I did mention the plot was predictable without surprises. Yet, with that said, there was a bit of a surprising jump scare moment for me, in the scene where Yelena find Bob in the void. That took me by surprise.\n\nThe cherry on top of the cake was the end credit scene. That was hype. At first I found the whole \"Cap does not approve (of them being the Avengers), and he will form his own team\" a bit lame. Especially given his relation with Bucky. They could just join forces. But after thinking about it, it makes sense that Cap, with his moral and ethics, would not approve of them being the Avengers, sort of formed by a corrupt Valentina, also even though his friend is part of the team.", "Excellent return to form from Marvel. Sentry was as OP as he should be, and the Void was terrifying. All the stuff with Bob and Yelena was *chef\u2019s kiss*. The team dynamic is fun and interesting, all the characters grow in satisfying ways. Red Guardian is hilarious as always. It\u2019s great to see Bucky given a leadership role where he shines. The Inception-style 3rd act was perfect, the movie kept getting better and better, and then \u201cbeating\u201d the void in that way was just the perfect way to end it. 4.5/5", "Finally a Marvel movie I liked. no bullshit, some adult action scenes, they deal with depression and other fucked up stuff...\n\nthe jokes land and the camera work was mostly well done.\n\npretty nice", "NO DULL MOMENT.

There's so much heart in it, the humor wasn't out of place, the performances were great and the soundtrack was good.\n\nEasily a 9/10 for me.\n\nI do have a small nitpick: like i wish we would've gotten a bit more time in the void with others, but at the same time this is Elena's movie first and foremost and she was the \"main piece\"(at least that's how i saw it, maybe some will disagree) so i can't really complain. Florence Pugh did a fantastic job and so did everyone else(i also love MCU's version of ghost and i was kinda left wanting more, i know that it's a very niche character but hey, a girl can dream!)\n\nI'm genuinely excited for the future and i can't wait to see the team in Doomsday.", "So, Olga's name is way up in the credits (5th or 6th), considering her screen time.

Couldn\u2019t have loved it more. More than I expected, and I already went in with high expectations. I will say I loved Florence being the MVP, and I don\u2019t understand so many criticisms about Sebastian\u2019s role. It felt right. To me it felt like (at least in the origins of the team) Bucky was the head and Yelena was the heart. \n\nAlso, we know a lot about Bucky. But they needed to truly establish the other characters, and they did an amazing job at that. And when Bucky comes into play, it clicks together beautifully. I am a Bucky girlie through and through and expected to be a bit disappointed by his role, but I really enjoyed him in this film. Walker and especially Ava felt a bit sidelined and I do think we could\u2019ve done well with more of them, but it doesn\u2019t harm the film. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to feel about Sam, though. I should\u2019ve expected the MCU to mess Bucky and him up after they gave us that scene in BNW, but man. I know we lack a lot of context, and I can sort of see Sam\u2019s point, but his actions still annoyed me and felt slightly petty. Then again, we do lack context, and to know what exactly happened in the conversation between Bucky and he. Nothing good, we know. And it broke my heart to see Bucky so sad and dejected about it. His hair was looking fabulous though. \n\nLastly, I will say I really buy them as a team that cares for one another. Them coming together felt natural and earned, and as much as I loved the OG Avengers\u2026 yeah, this new team feels more like found family than OG did.", "Watched this in NZ and absolutely loved it. Probably my favourite MCU movie out of all the ones I\u2019ve seen. The characters are incredibly endearing and you can\u2019t help but root for them to save the day, even when they\u2019re not particularly strong or powerful. Florence Pugh is a standout!", "What a great movie! Was emotionally invested from the get go. Great acting, action scenes and Valentina makes a great villian! Excited to see where we go from here with the New Avengers!", "We waited how long to find out who bought avengers tower to just still be avengerz tower?", "So will Sentry attacking New York be addressed in Daredevil S2?", "My only gripe with it is that Bucky didn\u2019t do very mich. Apart from getting the group to New York to confront Val, you could basically cut him out of the movie without changing anything. And his personal issues never felt like they were brought to the forefront like Yelenas, Bobs or even Walkers were.", "I understand where Marvel is going with the Thunderbolts* twist.\n\nI remembered that the 2000s was the first time Marvel geared up and seriously put the Avengers as a **team** on the map. That was before they even know what the shape of the first Avengers film was going to be like.\n\nYou can kind of tell how much stock was put in Ultimates and then a good stretch from New Avengers by Bendis to Secret Invasion as the cutting off point for the 2000s as a whole, and how much of it has made it to screen in the years since.\n\nFor the film, they went for a different yet similar route. They're putting the team on the map... >!again!<. No Spider-Man, no Wolverine to juice up sales like the publishing unit did back then, but a good effort is an effort worth praising.\n\nAnd as for why it's different? >!The comic New Avengers was about putting A-list characters on a B-list team.

First with the Yelena-Alexei talk, it hits hard as someone who's been alone for a long time now and is still directlionless in life. \n\nThe second time is when they all pulled out Bob from the void because I could only wish that I woukd have people like that do. Also, very heart-wrenching acting it felt so raw", "lmao why is Taskmaster even in this movie? They killed her off unceremoniously shortly after she appears. They could have just not include Taskmaster in this movie and save the character for another movie.

So it hit pretty close.", "Anyone else is sad about the post credit scene? Bucky tried to talk with Sam about the Avengers name and they've fought, I really love their friendship/rivalry and I would hate it to end\u00a0", "One of the most unique MCU films in terms of theme and messaging. I didn't expect it to deal with humans' inner struggle. If you have experienced loneliness and emptiness in your life this film is going to hit you like a rock. This is imo an \"Oscar-worthy\" film. I also enjoyed the action stunts and humor of the movie. It was a rollercoaster ride of emotions. I hope this is the great new beginning of the new MCU.

Overall it's Walker whom I feel the film most enhanced my appreciation for. It was nice seeing him warm up to Bob(by) over time \u2013 Bob's \"You're an asshole\" got one of the biggest audience reactions at my screening, lol.\n\nMost everything has already been said about Taskmaster so I'll just say that a part of me wonders if this isn't the last we've seen of her, as unlikely if not impossible as that sounds. Though that may just be me still being in shock over how quickly and unceremoniously she bowed out, especially when you remember what a tough life she'd already endured, as Yelena put it (not to mention her prominence in the marketing). I'd be curious to hear anything about that from Jake Schreier or anybody in the cast.", "For me personally, this was the best Marvel Film* since The Winter Soldier. I say film as it didn\u2019t feel like your generic superhero flick.\n\n+ The comedy wasn\u2019t overdone or forced, it was just enough to be entertaining.\n\n+ The plot was excellent as well as the buildup to the 3rd act. It felt raw and emotional. The pay off was definitely worth it,\n\n+ Acting was excellent across the board. It\u2019s so fucking nice to watch a marvel film that actually feels like a film. \n\n+ Effects were great.

But at a time when Marvel fatigue has taken a bite out of more than one fizzled blockbuster, it\u2019s a relief to watch a comic-book movie in which the smug wisecracking is dialed way down and the characters are given interior dimensions beyond their powers, including a certain emotional fragility.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/thunderbolts-review-marvel-the-new-avengers-1236381303/):\n\n>As with the Guardians of the Galaxy films, what works here is the uneasy tension within a team that comes together out of necessity, rather than any natural sense of affinity.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/thunderbolts-review-marvels-fun-supporting-avengers-1236379893/):\n\n>Fortunately in pure Hollywood fashion these past supporting stars rise to the occasion and get their chance to shine. Chief among them is Pugh, bringing real gravitas to Yelena in a darker portrayal than what she did in Black Widow. Stan finds new ways into Bucky/Winter Soldier now on his 10th go-round with the character, Russell really gets much to do here in a comeback for John Walker, as do Kurylenka and John-Kamen. Harbour, as he did in Black Widow, is here mostly for comic relief, relishing in his over-the-top antics, and newcomer to the franchise Pullman makes the most of a nerd-turned-dangerous-superhero, or antihero as all of them really are.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/thunderbolts-review-marvel-movie-1235119020/) (B-):\n\n>It\u2019s a force strong enough to bond a group of enemies into the world\u2019s greatest team of superheroes, and to malform decent people into indiscriminate murderers. It\u2019s a force strong enough to cohere a string of spandex-clad blockbusters into one of the defining cultural phenomena of the 21st century, and \u2014 just maybe \u2014 a force strong enough to save that series of blockbusters from collapsing under its own weight in the face of certain Doom. Time will tell. The good news for the MCU is that \u201cThunderbolts*\u201d buys them some more of it, and at a much-needed discount.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh/) (80):\n\n>For once, these Marvel movies feel genuinely working class: the headliners have skedaddled, leaving has-beens and day-players the chance to take center stage, in this movie and also in real life. The thought of watching forgotten characters from forgotten movies work through their issues may not dazzle you, but Pugh is, as usual, perfection. Louis-Dreyfus is an excellent villain. Pullman is doing complex work. Schreier\u2019s film makes you care, whether you gave a crap before or not, and at this point in the franchise that\u2019s a big accomplishment.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/thunderbolts-review-marvel-sebastian-stan-florence-pugh-david-harbour) (7/10):\n\n>Thunderbolts* has, like its sort-of-not-really antagonist, both a dark half and a light half. But only one of them is actually pretty great (hint: it\u2019s the one that involves plumbing the depths of the characters\u2019 worst memories).\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/thunderbolts-review-florence-pugh-sebastian-stan-keep-marvel-torch-lit-11723917) (75):\n\n>A lot of what works in the movie does so due to the talent of the performers. There aren't a lot of jokes or killer lines in this, but little bits of business that Pugh and Russell, in particular, make work. Harbour's loud, boorish Russian bear is funny at first, but alas, gets tiresome in a short amount of time.\n\n[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/thunderbolts-review-mcu-florence-pugh-1235319681/) (70):\n\n>The primary goal of this entry is to establish a new team of heroes. The secondary aim is to stop what\u2019s undeniably been a downward spiral. It succeeds in that respect at the very least.

Thunderbolts* is a pleasant surprise in the MCU; it only took a team-up of Marvel\u2019s unlikeliest superheroes to bring it out in them.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1846662/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-review/) (70):\n\n>Provides a spoonful of laugh-out-loud moments of sugar from David Harbour to help make the medicine go down.

He might as well have been some random, generic Master of the Mystic Arts instead of Stephen Goddamn Strange himself.\n\nWanda was just a generic slasher villain, complete 180 turn from her arc in her own show.

If I'm writing a story, about The Thing, from the Fantastic Four, and he gets into a big fight with Spider-Man, and millions of people out there say Who Would Win?

He doesn\u2019t magic limbs of off enemies or busses in half, he generates a portal or blade and physically cuts them.

{"subreddit": "MarvelStudios", "title": "Sam Wilson not having powers is really stupid.", "body": "   I\u2019m not one of those guys that want him back as falcon, but at least he stood out. His only reason for not getting powers is \u201che doesn\u2019t want to be like Steve\u201d \u201che wants to be a relatable every man\u201dwhich doesn\u2019t make sense because anyone can relate to Steve powers or not. There\u2019s no logical reason in universe (films or comics)  It\u2019s not inspiring or endearing like Batman, Deku or other street tiers, it just makes him look stubborn and weak. He\u2019s got tech to \u201ccompensate\u201d but marvel won\u2019t go too far because he\u2019ll be too much like iron man. Most of the tech he gets from Wakanda. Both films and comics have established multiple Safe alternatives to the OG serum. \n    \n    The social commentary of Him being a black Captain America after Isaiah Bradley already makes him stand out a lot from Steve and Bucky. He\u2019s also a therapist for veterans. Not to mention the wings (which often are broken, he just got a new suit in the comics because he got injured.) Not taking the serum especially in the movies case where he\u2019s about to fight a multiversal war just makes him look worse, especially to THAT crowd looking for reasons to hate him. I try to ignore it, but it doesn\u2019t do anything but force comparisons. Steve would\u2019ve held up better against red hulk. Steve would\u2019ve held up better against the random mercenaries in the film. \n\n    The problem is Marvel makes it a point that he refuses to get powers, he CHOOSES to not be better at his job, not that he\u2019s unable to. Batman\u2019s always training, he\u2019s at superhuman levels and backs it up, his whole thing is not having powers but still being one of the best fighters, best ANYTHING in DC. Not to mention Shang Chi, the robins, lady shiva, karate kid (all beating Sam) So many powerful characters that have no power. There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t see many people putting Sam Wilson in VS battles.\n\n    To me it seems like Marvel doesn\u2019t care about Sam Wilson at all. They just gave Sam the mantle of Captain America just to make us happy. Still no big stories, or iconic runs/moments, even from before he was Captain. They\u2019re Firm in not giving him too much so he doesn\u2019t look \u201cbetter\u201d than Steve, even tho that\u2019s up to the opinion of the readers. People still like Peter more than Miles despite him being way cooler on paper, even I do and people have called me Miles morales since I was in middle school. To be Cap you already have to have certain morals and ideals(which sam shares ofc) but they don\u2019t expand on what makes him special as a Superhero. Best comparisons again is all the recent inclusions to Miles Morales Spider-Man or any of the Blue Beetles or green lanterns. They share the name with their predecessor/ coworkers yet they\u2019re all CLEARLY distinct from eachother. Jaime, Miles, or any GL after Alan Scott gained WAY more powers and abilities, yet they all standout among eachother. Rhodey Stand out from Tony stark, even the other Batmen stood out from Bruce. \n\nAll out of love for a character I\u2019ve enjoyed since I was a kid watching superhero squad. He just seems a lil empty. At least back then He has his own name so you could ignore marvel not giving a shit about him. There\u2019s another falcon now so either way he\u2019s cooked. Shit Let ME write a Sam Wilson story at this point lol. \n\nTL:DR Marvel makes it hard to believe in Sams capabilities as cap because they keep pointing out his lack of power without any real compensation. They make it a point to put him in 2nd place, He always gets the scraps. They needa  either give him powers or put him at a \u201csuperhuman\u201d level.", "author": "0kdevv_", "upvotes": 0, "postID": "1kcakw1", "postImage": "https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kcakw1/sam_wilson_not_having_powers_is_really_stupid/", "postUrl": "/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kcakw1/sam_wilson_not_having_powers_is_really_stupid/", "comments": ["To me the argument that Sam has to take the serum is pretty much the same as asking why didn't Tony just build suits for everyone.\n\nIt would make sense in real life, why not take all the advantages possible.... but it gets boring in a movie/comic sense as everyone is just the same.\n\nThunderbolts lineup already has 3 super serum dudes, Sam doesn't need it.

We follow his transition from Falcon to Captain America in FATWS, when he comes to the conclusion that he's got what it takes to be Captain America.

The Serum should not be treated like a rare thing for somebody to take (it's fine for Walker to take it as it's fits his character but Sam's doesn't need it because well look at his suit, he's like a combo of Tony, Steve, and T'Challa into one person. He doesn't need the serum.)", "I mean stupid yes. But comics have to limit people. Why doesn\u2019t Tony always just his most powerful suit in comics?

Captain America... ironically implies that that's what defines Cap.", "Super serum is more useful in a street fight than against an Avenger-level threat. You can\u2019t defeat Galactus and Doom with a hand-to-hand combat.", "Did he ever have the serum to make that choice?\n\nAll I can remember is him answering a hypothetical from Zemo, but it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen TFATWS.", "Then that goes for Tony, Natasha, Rhodey, Clint and Yelena, too.  Right?", "I think it's fine if you don't want Sam to have powers, but it also needs to be reflected in his stories. Like Sam should absolutely be getting crushed in one on one hand fights. It makes sense that Steve can beat up an elevator full of guys or beat Batroc one on one in a fistfight. But Sam shouldn't be able to. \n\nWhen a see Sam in a hallway fight with highly trained merchs, I'm rolling my eyes when I see him win. Makes me like the character less.", "Wouldn't be shocked if part of it is to keep it from being uniform.", "Let him talk to birds.  Be comic accurate.", "I can't get into Sam no matter how hard I try but I think it's partially due to the fact that I am not a fan of Anthony Mackie's acting for the most part", ">To me the argument that Sam has to take the serum is pretty much the same as asking why didn't Tony just build suits for everyone.\n\nNot really.  \n\nThe serum permanently changes you and augments your strongest personality traits, for good or evil, which was the point of CA1 and Captain America vs Red Skull.", ">What I like about Sam Wilson is that his self questioning is believable.\n\nNot really, they fumbled it badly.\n\nIt would be believable if Sam didn't take the serum and kept failing.\n\nBut they couldn't handle the risk involved in a movie where Sam can't throw the shield at Mach 5 as a normal human, can't stop a truck because he's a normal human, can't catch a tree being swung by a rage monster because he's a normal human.\n\nSo instead of seeing Sam failing repeatedly, then reaching a crisis point where he has to take the serum at great risk/cost to himself to save others, we get a Sam that can casually do anything (often better than Steve Rogers) and the serum is just pointless chatter that isn't going to do anything for him.\n\nThe character is completely botched at this point.  What's the serum going to do for a normal human who can stop trucks?", "Why doesn\u2019t Tony always just his most powerful suit in comics? - Because they're all situational.  The Hulk Buster armor has one purpose, and one purpose only.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Tony build high tech suits and weapons for the rest of the avengers?  - Because most of them would be limited by the suits.  Only a few Avengers are normal humans without abilities that meet or exceed the suits.  The only ones that would benefit from it are Black Widow and Starlord.\n\nWhy does Thor not give everyone access to the powers of himself? - Because that's not how Thor works.\n\nWhy does Black Panther not make vibranium suits for every single avenger? - Because Wakanda is an extremely isolationist society that's spent its entire history hoarding power.\n\nWhy does the government not create an army of super soldiers? - Because the serum permanently augments personality traits, for good or bad, which was the whole point of the first Captain America movie.  The whole point was that they wouldn't get an army of super soldiers, they'd get an army of super villains.\n\nWhy don\u2019t all utilize Pym particles? - Limited resource, very limited usefulness.", "Why don't we just give the Serum to everyone then?

For one thing, we know from \"Loki\" that there was a single sacred timeline. And if it was formed from the universe in which Steve stays with Peggy, then Peggy's husband was always Steve. Secondly, we've already seen a time loop in Ms. Marvel where Kamala ended up in the past to help her grandmother, and it ended up being: the grandmother's stories of her rescue as a child that rescue was always Kamala. Which means that some time travel is already part of the main universe, and others create new alternate realities. \n\nAgain to reiterate, it's possible that this could have had something to do with the formation of the sacred timeline. Or even, if we allow for the fact that time travel creates an alternate universe, then for that universe the given time travel becomes part of it, which means some journeys for the universe are already part of it if it was originally formed by time travel, and other journeys create alternate universes if they have nothing to do with the given universe. \n\nAnd about Steve not trying to change anything, he knew it would end up relatively well, albeit with Tony's death, where's the guarantee that by trying to change things he wouldn't make things worse.

Any changes are just creating new timelines. we see the fallout of this in Loki, where a new timeline was created due to Loki escaping. It's also stated like a dozen times. \"Changing the past does not change the future\"\n\nRe: your Loki point. I think it's best understood that the Sacred Timeline was a collection of similar timelines, not one single timeline. Otherwise the whole show makes essentially 0 sense. They show multiple timelines in that show including one where Loki is Sylvie. The TVA is just making sure none of them veer off too far and lead to the creation of another Kang.\n\nRe: Ms. Marvel. I think the way to take that show and make it noncontradictory to Endgame is just that it's a different form of time travel. It's a more mystical one and using different tech. So perhaps its capable of a different sort of time travel that can create a time loop.", "Pepole fail to realize that simply traveling to the past/future does not cause a branch & thus, a loop can happen.", "They establish that\u2019s not how the quantum realm version of time travel works when Rhodey shares his \u201ckill baby Thanos\u201d plan.", "the thing that no one ever considers is this:\n\nthe sacred timeline that we've always been watching IS the alternate timeline that Cap creates by going back in time and living in the background with Peggy.\n\nthere would've been an original timeline where that didn't happen, and then when he went back that created a split... we've always been watching that split.\n\n  \nthe original timeline has Cap not return to it with Hulk and Sam just arguing until it's pruned. The one where old man Cap gives Sam his shield after living in the background IS the timeline that leads to HWR one day and thus is the one that has always been protected.", "As seen in Loki s2, the \"Sacred Timeline\" is many timelines woven together like a rope. The main similarity between all of them being that none of them have a Kang in them.\n\nAnyway, via the method of Time Travel Steve was using, it would have been impossible for Steve to go back into the maintenance and live there. Anytime you go into the past through the quantum realm, you immediately create a variant timeline as soon as you appear in the past. (The writers did this to side step paradoxes)\n\nIf Steve had a TVA time pad he could have done it, but he didn't. \n\nSteve was not married to Peggy in the main timeline.", "I get the confusion because it really comes down to how that scene was directed. Even the Russo brothers and screenwriters don't agree on what you're asking. \n\nFor it to make sense that Cap is returning to the main timeline in the end scene, it means he would have gone back and lived a life with Peggy in an alternate timeline and then used the Quantum Realm with the suit and Pym particles to return to that very moment with Bruce, Bucky and Sam. This is what the Russo brothers say happened. But they don't have him return to the platform with the suit....they have him sitting on a bench instead. \n\nThis is where the screenwriters don't agree because that little piece invalidates, to a certain extent, the explanation of how he used the Quantum Realm to return to that moment. The writers reject the alternate timeline theory and say Steve was always part of the main timeline, so for that to be true, it means he was always meant to be Peggy's husband. \n\nThis is where it gets messy because you're right, they kinda do a bad job of explaining what really happened. It doesn't really make sense that Steve was Peggy's husband all along in the timeline that we see (think Winter Soldier) cause that opens up a whole other series of unanswered questions. \n\nWith these 2 divergent ideas in mind: \n\n1) one could argue that the timeline we have always seen with Steve is an alternate timeline and not the main timeline where Steve never returns to the platform, which would make sense that he was already sitting on the bench and did not come through the Quantum Realm. Someone else wrote about this in the comments and I think it's a good argument. \n\n2) one could argue that Steve found another way to travel through the Quantum Realm to return to that spot where he knew they would be and quietly sat down on the bench without them noticing. I find it kinda hard to believe he was already sitting there when they set everything up and they didn't question an old man hanging out nearby, especially with Bucky's hypervigilance. I think it's possible he would have found another way back since he would have had access to Hank and Pym particles in the past just by associating with Peggy and her work. He would be instrumental to Hank's work with all the knowledge he has of the future.\n\n4) one could argue that when Steve went back to live a life with Peggy, he didn't do anything significant to change the timeline except live a private, quiet life with Peggy, which means he could remain in the main timeline that we see and patiently wait for everything to go down. This would mean Steve was always her husband, but a different Steve than the one we see in the hospital in Winter Soldier. Gets more confusing here. \n\n3) it was a bad directors choice to have him sitting on the bench and he did in fact travel back through the portal, which doesn't explain how he ended up on the bench without the suit on.\n\nJust traveling back in time does not create a new branch, but changing things significantly like removing the time stones does. Agents of SHIELD does a great job with time travel and FitzSimmons explain it way better than Bruce and Tony. They also bring in many other elements that we don't learn about in the movies. Highly recommend if you've never watched the show!!!\n\nThe fact that people are still arguing about this to this day means your confusion is valid! I believe it's a case of directors choice in leaving out information and hoping that viewers will correctly speculate on what happened. Realistically speaking, we don't really know how long Steve was sitting on that bench or when/where he came from.", "Steve went to live with Peggy on a branched timeline and came back to give Sam the shield after that life.

Either removing an Infinity Stone OR doing something contrary to the sacred timeline's \"script\" causes a branch to form.\n\n\nIf it was always \"in the sacred timeline's script\" for Steve to go back in time to be with Peggy, then there is no contradiction to that \"script\" and a branch would not form.\n\n\nMs. Marvel and Loki both support that time travel loops are possible and do occur. They also both support that going back in time doesn't inherently create a branch.\u00a0\n\n\nSide note: The idea that going back in time inherently causes a branch would make Steve's mission to return the stones impossible. It would also mean that it isn't OUR Sam that would get the shield.\n\n\nBut really at the end of the day, Steve showed back up on the bench and not the platform.

My personal explanation for that is the only explanation we get from that is from the Ancient One who just wants it back for her own reasons.

A lot of the negativity comes from people who either checked out emotionally after Endgame or who expected every project to have that same level of stakes and spectacle. The MCU shifted gears \u2014 it started exploring more character-driven stories, experimenting with genres (WandaVision, Moon Knight, Werewolf by Night), and expanding its universe in ways that don\u2019t always lead straight to a massive crossover event. That change threw some people off.\n\n\nBut here's the thing: the MCU is evolving, and not every phase has to be a nonstop blockbuster parade.

Things *were* good, *now* they're not.\n\n2.  You're using critics reviews to define \"good\", which is fairly pointless.  Critics give good reviews to maintain access, or for activism reasons, critic reviews are useless.  You want audience scores, like Cinemascore.  Critics don't matter, they aren't buying 100,000,000 tickets.  The audience is.\n\n3.  You're trying to carefully frame the discussion to get the answers you want.  Quantumania flopped, The Marvels set industry records in bombing, Eternals underperformed, Wakanda Forever underperformed, Love and Thunder is hated, Brave New World either flopped or bombed depending on whether or not the rumored budget is true.\n\nSecret Invasion is reviled, Ms. Marvel had very low viewership, Echo had very low viewership, X-Men 97 had extremely low viewership, Agatha had middling viewership, the only numbers on Daredevil I can find are below Agatha.\n\nYou need to deal with the number of people watching MCU products, not critic reviews.  Critic reviews don't stop Disney from shelving the MCU, people paying for their products does.\n\n4.  *\"it didn't fall off after Endgame, they just became less and less important to the general public\"* That's exactly what \"falling off\" means.\n\n5.  *so now that they're coming back to they're like Pre-Endgame, Endgame state, the haters will stop complaining*  It's not back to the Endgame state until every movie is in the 700m-1 billion range at the box office.  On the TV side, it needs to compete with the other streamer's flagship titles.  Fallout, a niche video game property, pulled 65 million viewers in 14 days, the MCU hovers around 10 million for an entire run.\n\nIt's a long way to go before the MCU is at a point where one could argue it's fine or back to where it was.", "The fact that people still down Marvel Studios and even Kevin Feige is just insane to me\n\nLord Feige does it again.

No way Home was only hyped due to nostalgia and fanservice.

Then We have Quantumania that is terrible, Eternals that is not terrible, not good, failed at making us love the new characters, and failed to add too much to the MCU, they just feel too detached for the general flow of the shared universe. Captain Marvel they failed because they wanted to shoehorn their new toys selling characters with Maria and Ms Marvel. \n\nThis fase is full of products with stories that nobody cared about, a lot of plots that totally ignored they are in an universe and that it happened things before, they barely evolve characters and universe. Also everyone is a standup commedian now and every movie is the same colouful and full of explossions and fireworks.\n\nIt felt like seeing Marvel studios for some reason trying to shove fanservice and new toys down your throat without any thought on making a good product.

The blip, the consequences of the blip, cosmic and on earth, the avengers dissapearance consequences, the new heroes that arise on that context and new problems. \n\nPeople didn't needed a chinese kung fu master who fights against mithological creatures.

They have to split it with the theaters. \n\n\nIt varies by company, country, and studio, but the general rule of thumb is that the studio receives: \n\n- 25% of the Chinese box office\n\n- 40% of international box office\n\n- 60/55/50% for the first/second/third+ weekends of the domestic box office\n\n\nAgain this is just a general average. Disney, for example, is notorious for playing hard ball and getting higher first-weekend percentages with domestic chains. \n\nSo dp/w:\n\nChina: 60m x .25 = 15m\n\nInt'l: 640m x .4 = 256m\n\nDomestic: \n\n1st weekend: 211m x .6 = 127m\n\n2nd weekend: 100m x .55 = 55m\n\n3rd+ weekend: 325m x .5 = 167.5m\n\n\nTotal is  620.5m in box office receipts going back to the studio, a far cry from the original 1.3b number. \n\nYou have the 200m budget and 160m p/a, that's 260.5 million profit from the box office receipts.

My recommendations if you're looking for something that are largely considered great or something very different are the following, hopefully scratching that itch for what you're looking for:\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy - You already met these characters in Avengers: Infinity War, but it's a very fun intergalactic romp with a completely unique group that has a lot of heart. Probably one of the funniest Marvel movies with an absolutely killer soundtrack.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier - Often considered the gold standard of Marvel movies. If you don't care too much about knowing all the loose threads, you can just jump in, but if you want the backstory, watch Cap 1. Winter Soldier is an all-out espionage thriller that keeps you on your toes and has some excellent action\n\nEternals - This is one of the more recent movies released, and honestly, it was one of the less popular, but it is decidedly not in line with the Marvel formula. It's a century spanning epic introducing a full family of unique characters. Not the bread and butter of the casual Marvel fan, but based on you not vibing with other more quintessential MCU movies, this might do it, who knows?\n\nDaredevil (TV) - A 3 season TV series that just got a continuation called Daredevil: Born Again. Some of the best Marvel has ever been, with a strong street-level war on crime. Has incredible action, compelling characters and drama, and works on all levels even outside of Marvel.\n\nI hope this helps get you a little bit further into this greater universe that has been enjoyed by so many of us, but if none of these hit for you, that's totally fine.

But now he's back out, and there is NO explanation, unless you want to watch the trainwrecks of shows that are Hawkeye and Echo. And I did, so I could watch this show. And boy do I regret it. And I STILL don't know why he got out! Don't tell me it was the blip. Disney does not get to just answer every legitimate and important question about the MCU's inconsistencies with \"it was the blip!\" No. How was it the blip? How does somebody who was very publicly and repeatedly disgraced as a cop killer and someone who literally blackmailed the whole FBI get to just waltz out of prison because some judges went missing? It don't make no sense. And apparently he has been out for a while, but Foggy Matt and Karen are just hanging out at a bar and laughing about how good and carefree their lives are?\n\n What show is this? It feels like a bad episode of NCIS, especially with every other line being about bad cops and good cops, and the thin blue line. \ud83e\udd22  karen foggy and Matt should all be freaking out about Fisk getting out, and trying to put him back in jail. But they all seem to have forgotten what was desperately important for the first three seasons of the show. \n\nSo Fisk gets out, and decides he wants to...run for mayor? Wtf? Why? \"So he can control the city\" he already controlled the city! He should be rebuilding his criminal empire. He can buy a politician like most rich people do. Fisk is not a politician. He hates public scrutiny. He is a criminal. More importantly, why would people vote for him? I get it, \"he's supposed to be trump!\" Omg, great. Because that dead horse of a story trope hasn't already been beaten enough. Fisk is literally a criminal mastermind who orchestrated the murder of both cops and journalists. No one would vote for him in real life. One guys in the show says \"he crushed somebody's head? I'd like to see that!\" Wwwwhhhat? Is this what these writers think of regular working people? They're just bloodthirsty savages waiting to find some psychopath to lead them to chaos and destruction? No. Nobody would vote for someone like Wilson Fisk, in any reality, not even the MCU.\n\n\nFoggy dies with no buildup. He is the second most pivotal character in the whole show, and they just kill him without any chance for us to get settled back in, or remember who he is, or have some kind of understanding of the cosmic underpinnings or ramifications of his death, or for Foggy to show what an important part of Matt and Karens lives he was, or any reason or justification why someone just starting the show now would care about foggy,, none of that. He just gets killed because a bad guy wanted revenge. For what? Foggy didn't do anything to bullseye! Matt got bullseye to fight Fisk, but kept preventing him from killing Fisk, which is how bullseye got injured. So he should want revenge against Matt. But he should want it even worse against kingpin, who killed his girl and manipulated him. Also, what happened to his bullseye pupils?\n\nNow Matt is sad, and karens leaving, but we have a brand new cast of characters we pulled straight from an episode of CSI, so you're happy with that, right?\nMatt is questioning being Daredevil AGAIN?! Half the third season he was questioning, then he tells sister Maggie \"I am daredevil, its who I am. Even God couldn't stop it now if he tried\" So we are just throwing out everything out about the og show, except the aesthetic, and the actors?\n\nThe new costume sucks. The og one was perfect. This new one looks completely generic. \n\nThe fight scene in episode 1 with Bullseye was soooo bad. Like, I know people say the fights look good in this show, but I don't see it. The action is muddled at best. They hide it behind bad camera angles, darkness, and strobe lights. In the old show, you felt every punch. In this one, you can barely see half the punches. \n\nI only saw one episode to be fair, but I will not give Disney any more of my viewing time just to see if they do anything to honor one of my favorite shows ever that they've completely ruined now. I don't care if Punisher shows up, they will ruin him like they ruined Daredevil and Fisk. We deserve better than this people! Remember in the 90s and 00s when we could all admit that superhero movies sucked? Why cant we just admit to ourselves that these crooks like Kevin Feige are just swindling us out of our money, are complete sheisters, and not to be trusted? I was honestly going to just skip this because I didn't think they could do it justice, but people said this was different and its better. I do not see it, at all. This is like the Hawkeye treatment for Daredevil. Pointless story, poorly written characters with no clear or compelling motivations, bad fight choreography, worse special effects, and uneven acting. I'm so passed right now, I don't think I will ever watch a Disney marvel show again.

Given that Disney/Marvel and Sony have problems reaching deals to use Spidey in MCU movies, would it be simpler if Marvel simply focused on animated series for Spidey going forward?\n\nSecret Wars is probably gonna involve a sort of \"multiversal reboot\" of the MCU, so everyone is probably gonna have some shake-ups to established backstories anyway. Would it be a deal-breaker for fans if Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man became the new official backstory for the MCU's Spidey, and the main source for new Spidey stories? Obviously this would mean no more live-action Spidey movies in the MCU, and would even mean that any team-up or crossover events would need to be animated... but would this be a small price to pay to stop Marvel having to go cap in hand to Sony every time they want to use him for something, and to stop having to deal with Sony's insistence at constantly trying to turn everything into an advertisement for their non-MCU movies?\n\nThere could still be \"movies\" under this structure; instead of releasing a two-hour movie in cinemas, Marvel could release an animated miniseries of 4 half-hour episodes on D+.

S3** - See explanation for What If...? S2.\n* **Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man S1** - Some characters from this might pop-up in Secret Wars, but it's unlikely. Probably skippable.\n* **Captain America: Brave New World** - Probably watch. It's unclear right now how relevant this movie will be to the upcoming movies, but since part of it deals with starting up a new Avengers team, there will likely be some amount of relevance.

I wish we could've got like a small explanation for how they know Tiamut is a celestial, and if they understand what that means (that celestials essentially create planets, stars, moons etc) and just their reaction to the fact that they're essentially mining a god who could've created other planets, moons and stars etc.", "I'd add that Tiamat's conciousness joined the unimind. Maybe the knowledge of Adamantium came from there? like they went \"hey, convert me into this, it'll be easier\"", "Because they couldn't keep ignoring that The Eternals happened.", "I have no idea. I had forgotten everything that has happened in the Eternals movie because there was literally nothing about the movie that was worth remembering, and that's just very sad. Even if I do rewatch the Eternals, I am still not going to remember anything. I remember Captain America Brave New World a lot more than this one.", "For lazy plot reasons", "Would have been an interesting way of including Sersi in Brave New World, I'm hoping that her character gets to stick around in the MCU and having her being a calmer bridge between Avengers and Eternals might work.", "Maybe Peter Quill told them. I mean, he is on earth right now.", "Did they ever say Tiamut's name? I only remember them calling it Celestial Island.\n\nThough all it would take is Peter Quill, Sprite, Karun, or Dane Whitman to spill the beans since they all know about Celestials and are on Earth.", "Yeah, given how 9/10 Eternals are either dead, kidnapped, or in space, I think there are only four people on Earth who know Tiamut\u2019s name at the end of \u2018The Eternals\u2019.   \nMaybe Karun published everything he filmed.", "Yea exactly, I mean who else would know better about the Tiamut situation than Sersi herself! Plus would've been nice just see one of the Eternals in general.", "I\u2019m pretty sure Sersi was picked up by another celestial and taken to space at the end Eternals right?", "Yea but it would've been nice if they gave like a throaway line about Peter Quill educating them about Tiamut and Celestials in general", "Didn't they say Tiamut? \ud83e\udd14 Unless I heard wrong, my bad. But it would've been a better and more meaningful connection to Eternals if one of their names was mentioned if not a cameo atleast", "I think Karun's camera was destroyed by Sprite... and speaking of Sprite, she's technically the only Eternal left on earth coz Arishem didn't both to kidnap her since she no longer has powers lol, would've been nice if she had a cameo where she informs them about Tiamut.", "Ah I completely forgot about that... Bring on the \"yea we spoke to the celestials and turns out we're all good here, barely an inconvenience\" exposition line", "He had 3 or 4 cameras that he kept pulling out after the previous one was smashed. The cameras that were broken were pretty much just thrown to the ground to break the lenses so the videos could still be retrieved.", "Oh yea you're right now I remember!"], "category": "new", "linkTitle": "Too Many Requests"}
